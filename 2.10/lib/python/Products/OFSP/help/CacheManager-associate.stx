Cache manager associations
 
  For background information, see the
  <a href="Caching.stx">description of cache management</a>.

  The 'Associate' form lets you search for cacheable objects and
  make or break multiple cache management associations at once.
  Simply select the search criteria then click the 'Locate'
  button.  Zope will return a list of cacheable objects with a
  checkbox for each one.  Select or unselect objects and click the
  'Save changes' button when you're done.
