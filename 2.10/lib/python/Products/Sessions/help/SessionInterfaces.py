    visitors, and for servicing requests from Session Data Managers
    related to the browser id.
    """
    def encodeUrl(url, style='querystring'):
        """
        Encodes a provided URL with the current request's browser id
        and returns the result.  Two forms of URL-encoding are supported:
        'querystring' and 'inline'.  'querystring' is the default.

        If the 'querystring' form is used, the browser id name/value pair
        are postfixed onto the URL as a query string.  If the 'inline'
        form is used, the browser id name/value pair are prefixed onto
        the URL as the first two path segment elements.

        For example:

         The call encodeUrl('http://foo.com/amethod', style='querystring')
         might return 'http://foo.com/amethod?_ZopeId=as9dfu0adfu0ad'.

         The call encodeUrl('http://foo.com/amethod, style='inline')
         might return 'http://foo.com/_ZopeId/as9dfu0adfu0ad/amethod'.
