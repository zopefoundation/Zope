"""test script for gadfly client and server

Usage:  This script interacts with the test database generated
  by gftest.py.  To start the server from the directory containing
  the dbtest directory use:

     python gfstest.py start

  THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU CREATED THE test DATABASE IN
  DIRECTORY dbtest FIRST USING 

     python gftest.py dbtest

  UNLESS YOU RUN THE SERVER IN THE BACKGROUND THE SERVER WILL
  HOG THE WINDOW YOU STARTED IT IN AND YOU WILL HAVE TO USE ANOTHER
  WINDOW UNTIL THE SERVER IS SHUT DOWN (SEE BELOW).

  Then from *anywhere* (on the same machine) access the database
  using
     python gfstest.py restart
       - restart the server (reread the database)
     python gfstest.py checkpoint
       - force checkpoint the server
     python gfstest.py queries
       - run some example queries and updates
     python gfstest.py policy_test
       - test the policies test and test1 created by the startup
         function in this module.
     python gfstest.py bogusshutdown
       - attempt to shut down the server with a bogus password
         [should generate an exception]

...and finally
     python gfstest.py shutdown
       - shut down the server for real.

As mentioned the startup function of this module illustrates
how to create a "startup" function for a server and initialize policy
objects with named, prepared queries.
