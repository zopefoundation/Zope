ZGadflyDA

  The ZGadflyDA product provides support for Gadfly database adapter
  objects in the Zope environment.

  Using Multiple Databases with ZGadflyDA

    The ZGadflyDA is intended mainly for demonstration purposes.

    It automatically creates a 'gadfly' directory in your Zope var directory
    with a 'demo' subdirectory, which provides a demo database.

    To add or use additional databases, simply add (or link) additional
    directories to your 'var/gadfly' directory.
