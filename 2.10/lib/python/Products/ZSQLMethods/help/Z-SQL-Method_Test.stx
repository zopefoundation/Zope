Z SQL Method - Test: Test the validity of your SQL statement
  
    Description

        Test a SQL method.
  
    Controls

        '*[arument names]*' -- There will be one text field for each
        argument specified for the SQL method. The text field will
        contain the default value.  **Important:** You must enter a
        value matching the specified argument type, otherwise a "Type
        Error" is returned.
        
        'Submit Query' -- Causes the query to be executed and the
        results are returned as an HTML table. If the query was had a
        syntax error or the accessed table did not exist, a
        database-specific error message is returned in form of an
        exception.
        
        If you have a SQL statement that does not return any data,
        Zope will tell you that this SQL statement was not a
        query and will not display any results.
