<h4>Basics</h4>
<p>
SiteAccess started as a Product to enable Zope Virtual Hosting, then became more
generalized. Virtual Hosting is the ability to publish sub-objects of a Zope hierarchy
as though they were the root of their own site.  For example, it allows
'http:/www.silly-walks.org/current' to publish the Zope object 'silly-walks/current'
instead of just 'current'.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
See:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/SiteAccess2/vhosting">Virtual Site Hosting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/SiteAccess2/otheruse">Other Uses of Access Rules</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>What does SiteAccess do?</h4>
<p>
SiteAccess provides the ability to force ZPublisher to call objects
of your choice as it enters any folder.  With this capability, you can designate a method
in the Zope root to examine the request parameters and alter or replace the URL. 
</p>
<p>If an Access Rule is broken, and is preventing normal access, it can be disabled by
restarting Zope with environment variable SUPPRESS_ACCESSRULE set.</p>
