class TransientObject:
    """
    A transient object is a temporary object contained in a transient
    object container.

    Most of the time you'll simply treat a transient object as a
    dictionary. You can use Python sub-item notation::

      SESSION['foo']=1
      foo=SESSION['foo']
      del SESSION['foo']

    When using a transient object from Python-based Scripts or DTML
    you can use the 'get', 'set', and 'delete' methods instead.

    Methods of transient objects are not protected by security
    assertions.

    It's necessary to reassign mutuable sub-items when you change
    them. For example::

      l=SESSION['myList']
      l.append('spam')
      SESSION['myList']=l

    This is necessary in order to save your changes.  Note that this caveat
    is true even for mutable subitems which inherit from the
    Persistence.Persistent class.
