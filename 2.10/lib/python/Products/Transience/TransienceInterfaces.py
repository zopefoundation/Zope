Transient Objects

  TransientObjectContainers are objects which contain zero or more
  TransientObjects.  They implement the following interfaces:

    - ItemWithId

    - StringKeyedHomogenousItemContainer

    - TransientItemContainer

  In particular, one uses the 'new_or_existing' method on
  TransientObjectContainers to retrieve or create a TransientObject
  based on a given string key.

  If add or delete notifications are registered with the container,
  they will be called back when items in the container are added or
  deleted, with the item and the container as arguments.  The
  callbacks may be registered either as bound methods, functions, or
  physical paths to Zope Script (Python Script or External Method)
  objects (e.g. '/some/resolvable/script/name').  In any of these
  cases, the delete and add notifications will be called with
  arguments allowing the callbacks to operate on data representing the
  state of the transient object at the moment of addition or deletion
  (see setAddNotificationTarget and setDelNotificationTarget below).

  TransientObjects are containerish items held within
  TransientObjectContainers and they implement the following
  interfaces:

    - ItemWithId

    - Transient

    - DictionaryLike

    - TTWDictionary

    - ImmutablyValuedMappingOfPickleableObjects

  Of particular importance is the idea that TransientObjects do not
  offer the contract of "normal" ZODB container objects; mutations
  made to items which are contained within a TransientObject cannot be
  expected to persist.  Developers need explicitly resave the state of
  a subobject of a TransientObject by placing it back into the
  TransientObject via the TransientObject.__setitem__ or .set methods.
  This requirement is due to the desire to allow people to create
  alternate TransientObject implementations that are *not* based on
  the ZODB.  Practically, this means that when working with a
  TransientObject which contains mutable subobjects (even if they
  inherit from Persistence.Persistent), you *must* resave them back
  into the TransientObject.  For example::

    class Foo(Persistence.Persistent):
        pass

    transient_object = transient_data_container.new('t')
    foo = transient_object['foo'] = Foo()
    foo.bar = 1
    # the following is *necessary* to repersist the data
    transient_object['foo'] = foo
