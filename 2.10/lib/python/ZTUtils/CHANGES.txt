    Version 1.1.4

      Features Added

        - Under Python 2.2, Iterator both accepts and produces Python
          iterator objects.

        - first() and last() methods allow you to tell whether the
          current element is different from the next or previous
          element.  This is most useful when the sequence is sorted.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Handle both string and class Unauthorized exceptions.

        - Batch construction masked sequence errors, such as
          Unauthorized.
