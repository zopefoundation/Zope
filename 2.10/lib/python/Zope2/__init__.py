"""Zope application package."""

# Before this version of Zope, "import Zope" always opened the
# database automatically.  Unfortunately, that strategy caused the
# Python import lock to be held by the main thread during database
# initialization, which lead to a deadlock if other threads required
# something to be imported before completing initialization.  This can
# be a big problem for ZEO.

# Now the database is opened when you call startup(), app(), or
# debug().

# This version is transitional.  If you have a script that no longer
# works because it needs the database to be opened on calling "import
# Zope", you can set the environment variable ZOPE_COMPATIBLE_STARTUP
# to a non-empty value.  Then "import Zope2" will automatically open
# the database as it used to.  Or better, update the script to call
# Zope2.startup() right after importing the Zope package.  A future
# version of Zope will remove this backward compatibility, since the
# old behavior is likely to cause problems as ZODB backends, like ZEO,
# gain new features.
