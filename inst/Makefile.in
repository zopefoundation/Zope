# inplace:     Install a software home into to the source directory.
#
# Note: We used to run 'build_ext -i' for 'inplace', but that was
# suboptimal because it had a tendency to try to rebuild all of the
# (possibly  already-built) extensions that might be built during a
# previous 'make' step.  built_ext doesn't understand '--build-base'
# and friends so we can't stop it from doing this easily.  So instead,
# we rely on the stock install step and name the prefix as the current
# directory.  This is a little less efficient than just building the
# extensions because it also compiles bytecode, but it's more intuitive and
# less expensive in the common case than letting distutils
# potentially rebuild the binaries when we've done that already.
