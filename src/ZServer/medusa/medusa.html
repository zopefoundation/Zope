<h1> <b>Medusa</b>: A High-Performance Internet Server Architecture </h1>

<h2> What is Medusa? </h2>

Medusa is an architecture for high-performance, robust, long-running
TCP/IP servers (like HTTP, FTP, and NNTP).  Medusa differs from most
other server architectures in that it runs as a single process,
multiplexing I/O with its various client and server connections within
a single process/thread.

<p>

Medusa  is written in  <a  href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, a
high-level  object-oriented language that  is particularly well suited
to building powerful, extensible servers.   Medusa can be extended and
modified at  run-time, even  by the end-user.    User 'scripts' can be
used to completely change the behavior of the server,  and even add in
completely new server types.

<h2> How Does it Work? </h2>

Most Internet servers  are built on a 'forking'  model.  ('Fork' is  a
Unix term  for starting a new  process.)  Such servers actually invoke
an  entire  new  process  for every  single  client connection.   This
approach is  simple  to implement,  but does  not  scale  very well to
high-load situations.  Lots of clients  mean a lot of processes, which
gobble up    large  quantities of virtual    memory   and other system
resources.  A  high-load server thus needs  to  have a lot  of memory.
Many  popular Internet servers  are running with hundreds of megabytes
of memory.

<p>
<h3>The I/O bottleneck. </h3>
<p>
      
The vast  majority of  Internet servers  are I/O bound   - for any one
process,  the CPU is sitting idle  99.9%  of the time, usually waiting
for input from an external device (in  the case of an Internet server,
it  is waiting   for  input   from  the  network).   This  problem  is
exacerbated by the imbalance between server and client bandwidth: most
clients are connecting at relatively low bandwidths (28.8 kbits/sec or
less, with network delays and inefficiencies it can be far lower).  To
a typical server  CPU, the time between  bytes for such a client seems
like an  eternity!  (Consider that a 200  Mhz CPU can  perform roughly
50,000 operations for each byte received from such a client).
      
<p>

A simple metaphor for a 'forking' server is that of a supermarket
cashier: for every 'customer' being processed [at a cash register],
another 'person' must be created to handle each client session.  But
what if your checkout clerks were so fast they could each individually
handle hundreds of customers per second?  Since these clerks are
almost always waiting for a customer to come through their line, you
have a very large staff, sitting around idle 99.9% of the time!  Why
not replace this staff with a single <i> super-clerk </i>, flitting
from aisle to aisle ?

<p>

This is exactly how Medusa works!  It multiplexes all its I/O through
a single select() loop - this loop can handle hundreds, even thousands
of simultaneous connections - the actual number is limited only by your
operating system.  For a more technical overview, see
<a href="http://www.nightmare.com/medusa/async_sockets.html">
Asynchronous Socket Programming</a>

<h2> Why is it Better? </h2>

<h3> Performance </h3>
<p>

The most obvious advantage to a single long-running server process is
a dramatic improvement in performance.  There are several types of
overhead involved in the forking model:
<ul>
  <li> <b> Process creation/destruction. </b>
  <p>

  Starting up a new process is an expensive operation on any operating
  system.  Virtual memory must be allocated, libraries must be
  initialized, and the operating system now has yet another task to
  keep track of.  This start-up cost is so high that it is actually
  <i>noticeable</i> to people!  For example, the first time you pull
  up a web page with 15 inline images, while you are waiting for the
  page to load you may have created and destroyed at least 16
  processes on the web server.

  <p>
  <li> <b> Virtual Memory </b>
  <p>

  Each process also requires a certain  amount of virtual memory space
  to be  allocated on its  behalf.  Even though most operating systems
  implement a 'copy-on-write'    strategy that makes this  much   less
  costly than it could be,  the end result is still  very wasteful.  A
  100-user FTP server can  still easily require hundreds  of megabytes
  of real  memory in order  to avoid thrashing (excess paging activity
  due to lack of real memory).

</ul>

  <b>Medusa</b> eliminates  both  types  of  overhead.  Running  as  a
  single   process,   there   is   no per-client  creation/destruction
  overhead.  This means each client request  is answered very quickly.
  And virtual memory  requirements  are lowered dramatically.   Memory
  requirements can even be controlled with  more precision in order to
  gain  the  highest performance  possible   for a particular  machine
  configuration.

<h3> Persistence </h3>
<p>

Another major advantage to the single-process model is
<i>persistence</i>.  Often it is necessary to maintain some sort of
state information that is available to each and every client, i.e., a
database connection or file pointer.  Forking-model servers that need
such shared state must arrange some method of getting it - usually via
an IPC (inter-process communication) mechanism such as sockets or
named pipes.  IPC itself adds yet another significant and needless
overhead - single-process servers can simply share such information
within a single address space.

<p>

Implementing persistence in Medusa is easy - the address space of its
process (and thus its open database handles, variables, etc...) is
available to each and every client.

<h3> Not a Strawman </h3>

All right, at this point many of my readers will say I'm beating up on
a strawman.  In fact, they will say, such server architectures are
already available - like Microsoft's Internet Information Server.
IIS avoids the above-named problems by using <i>threads</i>.  Threads
are 'lightweight processes' - they represent multiple concurrent
execution paths within a single address space.  Threads solve many of
the problems mentioned above, but also create new ones:

  <ul>
    <li>'Threaded' programs are very difficult to write - especially
        with servers that want to utilize the 'persistence' feature -
        great care must be taken when accessing or modifying shared resources.
    <li>There is still additional system overhead when using threads.
    <li>Not all operating systems support threads, and even on those
        that do, it is difficult to use them in a portable fashion.
  </ul>

  <p>   Threads  are  <i>required</i>  in  only a    limited number of
  situations.  In many    cases where  threads  seem  appropriate,  an
  asynchronous  solution can actually  be  written with less work, and
  will perform better.  Avoiding the use of  threads also makes access
  to  shared resources (like  database  connections) easier to manage,
  since multi-user locking is not necessary.

  <p> <b>Note:</b> In the rare case where threads are actually
  necessary, Medusa can of course use them, if the host operating system
  supports them.  For example, an image-conversion or fractal-generating
  server might be CPU-intensive, rather than I/O-bound, and thus a good
  candidate for running in a separate thread.

<p>
Another solution  (used by many  current  HTTP servers on Unix)  is to
'pre-spawn' a large number of processes - clients are attached to each
server  in  turn.  Although  this  alleviates  the performance problem
<i>up to that number  of users</i>, it still  does not scale well.  To
reliably and efficiently handle <i>[n]</i> users, <i>[n]</i> processes
are still necessary.

<h3> Other Advantages </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Extensibility</b>
    <p>

      Since Medusa is written in Python, it  is easily extensible.  No
      separate compilation is necessary.  New facilities can be loaded
      and  unloaded into  the   server without  any  recompilation  or
      linking, even while the server is running.  [For example, Medusa
      can be configured to automatically upgrade  itself to the latest
      version every so often].

      <p>
    <li> <b> Security </b>
      <p>
      
      Many  of the  most popular  security holes  (popular, at  least,
      among the mischievous) exploit the fact that servers are usually
      written in a low-level language.  Unless such languages are used
      with extreme care,  weaknesses  can be introduced that  are very
      difficult    to  predict  and    control.  One  of  the favorite
      loop-holes is the 'memory buffer overflow', used by the Internet
      Worm (and many others)   to gain unwarranted access to  Internet
      servers.
  
  </ul>
    <p>
  
      Such  problems  are  virtually non-existent  when   working in a
      high-level language like Python, where for example all access to
      variables and their components are checked at run-time for valid
      range operations.   Even unforseen errors  and operating  system
      bugs can  be caught -  Python includes a full exception-handling
      system  which  promotes the  construction of  'highly available'
      servers.  Rather  than crashing  the entire server,  Medusa will
      usually inform the user, log the error, and keep right on running.

<h2> Current Features </h2>

<ul>
    <li>  <p>  The  currently  available version  of   Medusa includes
    integrated World   Wide   Web  (<b>HTTP</b>)  and  file   transfer
    (<b>FTP</b>)  servers.   This combined server    can solve a major
    performance  problem at any    high-load  site, by replacing   two
    forking servers  with a single  non-forking, non-threading server.
    Multiple servers of each type can also be instantiated. <p>

    <li> <p> Also  included is  a secure 'remote-control'  capability,
    called  a <b>monitor</b>  server.    With   this server   enabled,
    authorized users can 'log in' to the  running server, and control,
    manipulate, and examine   the server  <i>   while it is    running
    </i>. <p>

    <li> <p> A 'chat server' is included, as a sample server
    implementation.  It's simple enough to serve as a good
    introduction to extending Medusa.  It implements a simple IRC-like
    chat service that could easily be integrated with the HTTP server
    for an integrated web-oriented chat service.  [For example, a
    small Java applet could be used on the client end to communicate
    with the server].
    <p>

    <li> <p> Several extensions are available for the HTTP server, and
    more will become available over time.  Each of these extensions can
    be loaded/unloaded into the server dynamically.<p>
        
    <dl>
    
        <dt> <b> Status Extension </b> <dd> Provides status
        information via the HTTP server.  Can report on any or all of
        the installed servers, and on the extensions loaded into the
        HTTP server.  [If this server is running Medusa, you should be
        able to see it <a href="/status">here</a>]
    
        <dt> <b> Default Extension </b> <dd> Provides the 'standard'
        file-delivery http server behavior.  Uses the same abstract
        filesystem object as the FTP server.  Supports the HTTP/1.1
        persistent connection via the 'Connection: Keep-Alive' header.

	<dt> <b> HTTP Proxy Extension </b> <dd> Act as a proxy server for HTTP
        requests.  This lets Medusa  be  used as a 'Firewall'  server.
        Plans for this  extension include cache support, filtering (to
        ignore,           say,      all            images         from
        'http://obnoxious.blinky.advertisements.com/'),       logging,
        etc...

    </dl>
    
    <p> <li> An API is evolving for users to  extend not just the HTTP
    server but Medusa as a whole, mixing in other server types and new
    capabilities  into existing  servers.  NNTP and  POP3 servers have
    already been written, and will probably  be provided as an add-on.
    I am actively encouraging other developers to produce (and if they
    wish, to market) Medusa extensions.
