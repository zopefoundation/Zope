        Etags can also be used to deal with the 'Lost Updates Problem'.
        An HTTP Client such as Amaya that supports PUT for editing can
        use the Etag value returned in the head of a GET response in the
        'if-match' header submitted with a PUT request.  If the Etag
        for the requested resource in the PUT request's 'if-match' header
        is different from the current Etag value returned by this method,
        the PUT will fail (it means that the state of the resource has
        changed since the last copy the Client recieved) because the
        precondition (the 'if-match') fails (the submitted Etag does not

        fail on certain REQUESTS because:

         o The object is not stored in the ZODB, or

         o A Request such as PUT changes the oid or database mtime
           *AFTER* the Response has been written out, but the Etag needs
           to be updated and returned with the Response of the PUT request.

        Thus, Etags need to be refreshed manually when an object changes.

    This class is the basis for supporting Etags in Zope.  It's main
    function right now is to support the *Lost Updates Problem* by
    allowing Etags and If-Match headers to be checked on PUT calls to
    provide a *Seatbelt* style functionality.  The Etags is based on
    the databaes mtime, and thus is updated whenever the
    object is updated.  If a PUT request, or other HTTP or Dav request
    comes in with an Etag different than the current one, that request
    can be rejected according to the type of header (If-Match,
    If-None-Match).
