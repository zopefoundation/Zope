    This item is <span style="color: red">locked by WebDAV</span> as a
    <strong>Lock-Null Resource</strong>.  A lock-null resource is
    created when a resource is locked before it is fully created,
    basically reserving its name.  When the owner of this resource
    issues a command to either fill it with content, or turn it into a
    collection (folder), that object will replace this one.
