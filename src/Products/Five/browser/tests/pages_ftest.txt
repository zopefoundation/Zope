Functional Browser Pages Test
=============================

This test tests publishing aspects of browser pages.  Let's register
some:

  >>> import Products.Five.browser.tests
  >>> from Zope2.App import zcml
  >>> zcml.load_config("configure.zcml", Products.Five)
  >>> zcml.load_config('pages.zcml', package=Products.Five.browser.tests)

Let's also add one of our stub objects to play with:

  >>> from Products.Five.tests.testing.simplecontent import manage_addSimpleContent
  >>> manage_addSimpleContent(self.folder, 'testoid', 'Testoid')


Docstrings
----------

In Zope 2, objects normally have to have a docstring in order to be
published.  This crazy requirement luckily isn't true for zope.publisher, so
it should be possible to write docstring-less view classes that are
still published through ZPublisher.

We see that even though the callables have no docstring, they are
published nevertheless:

  >>> print(http(r"""
  ... GET /test_folder_1_/testoid/nodoc-function HTTP/1.1
  ... """))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  No docstring

  >>> print(http(r"""
  ... GET /test_folder_1_/testoid/nodoc-method HTTP/1.1
  ... """))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  No docstring

  >>> print(http(r"""
  ... GET /test_folder_1_/testoid/nodoc-object HTTP/1.1
  ... """))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  No docstring


Security
--------

Browser pages need to be protected with a permission.  Let's test
those; we start by adding two users:

  >>> uf = self.folder.acl_users
  >>> _ignored = uf._doAddUser('viewer', 'secret', [], [])
  >>> _ignored = uf._doAddUser('manager', 'r00t', ['Manager'], [])

  >>> protected_view_names = [
  ...     'eagle.txt', 'falcon.html', 'owl.html', 'flamingo.html',
  ...     'condor.html']
  >>> 
  >>> public_view_names = [
  ...     'public_attribute_page',
  ...     'public_template_page',
  ...     'public_template_class_page',
  ...     'nodoc-method', 'nodoc-function', 'nodoc-object',
  ...     'dirpage1', 'dirpage2']
  >>> 
  >>> ViewManagementScreens = 'View management screens'

As a normal user we shouldn't get to see those pages protected with
the 'View management screens' permission.  Thus we expect a 401
Unauthorized:

  >>> for view_name in protected_view_names:
  ...     response = self.publish('/test_folder_1_/testoid/%s' % view_name,
  ...                             basic='viewer:secret')
  ...     status = response.getStatus()
  ...     self.assertTrue(status == 401, (status, 401, view_name))

Methods of views which were not explicitly declared as allowed should not be
accessible TTW, even if we have the permission to render the view:

  >>> response = self.publish('/test_folder_1_/testoid/eagle.method/mouse',
  ...                         basic='viewer:secret')
  >>> self.assertEqual(response.getStatus(), 404)

The same should apply for the user if he has all other permissions
except 'View management screens':

  >>> permissions = self.folder.possible_permissions()
  >>> permissions.remove(ViewManagementScreens)
  >>> self.folder._addRole('Viewer')
  >>> self.folder.manage_role('Viewer', permissions)
  >>> self.folder.manage_addLocalRoles('viewer', ['Viewer'])

  >>> for view_name in protected_view_names:
  ...     response = self.publish('/test_folder_1_/testoid/%s' % view_name,
  ...                             basic='viewer:secret')
  ...     status = response.getStatus()
  ...     self.assertTrue(status == 401, (status, 401, view_name))

If we grant 'View management screens' now, the protected views should
become viewable:

  >>> self.folder.manage_role('Viewer', [ViewManagementScreens])
  >>> for view_name in protected_view_names:
  ...     response = self.publish('/test_folder_1_/testoid/%s' % view_name,
  ...                             basic='viewer:secret')
  ...     status = response.getStatus()
  ...     self.assertTrue(status == 200, (status, 200, view_name))

Managers should always be able to view anything, including proctected
stuff:

  >>> for view_name in protected_view_names:
  ...     response = self.publish('/test_folder_1_/testoid/%s' % view_name,
  ...                             basic='manager:r00t')
  ...     self.assertEqual(response.getStatus(), 200)

All public views should always be accessible by anyone:

  >>> for view_name in public_view_names:
  ...     response = self.publish('/test_folder_1_/testoid/%s' % view_name)
  ...     status = response.getStatus()
  ...     self.assertTrue(status == 200, (status, 200, view_name))



Miscellaneous
-------------

Zope 2 always wants objects in the traversal graph to have a __name__.
That is also true for views, e.g. a view constructed from a simple
class bearing only a __call__ method:

  >>> print(http(r'''
  ... GET /test_folder_1_/testoid/callview.html HTTP/1.1
  ... '''))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  I was __call__()'ed

or a __call__ object that's callable, such as a ViewPageTemplateFile:

  >>> print(http(r'''
  ... GET /test_folder_1_/testoid/calltemplate.html HTTP/1.1
  ... '''))
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  <p>The falcon has taken flight</p>

Clean up
--------

  >>> from zope.component.testing import tearDown
  >>> tearDown()
