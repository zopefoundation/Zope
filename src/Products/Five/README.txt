Introduction
------------

"It was the dawn of the third age of Zope. The Five project was a dream
given form. Its goal: to use Zope 3 technologies in Zope 2.7 by
creating a Zope 2 product where Zope 3 and Zope 2 could work out their
differences peacefully." -- Babylon 5, creatively quoted

"The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR
ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY RELATED TO FIVE.

THE LAW OF FIVES IS NEVER WRONG." -- Principia Discordia

What is Five?
-------------

The goal of five is to allow Zope 2 developers to use Zope 3
technology right now, inside of Zope 2. Additionally, this allows a
gradual evolution of Zope 2 code to Zope 3.

Five already makes the following Zope 3 technologies available in Zope
2:

* Zope 3 interfaces

* ZCML (Zope Configuration Markup Language)

* Adapters

* Zope 3 views, even for standard Zope objects

* layers & skins

* schema/forms machinery, including edit and add forms.

* Zope 2 security declarations in ZCML instead of in Python code.

* Content Providers and Viewlets
