# Directive: locale
#
# Description:
#     Overwrite the locale settings found in the environment by supplying a
#     locale name to be used. See your operating system documentation for
#     locale information specific to your system. If the requested locale is
#     not supported by your system, an error will be raised and Zope will not
#     start.
#
# Default: unset
#
# Example:
#
#    locale fr_FR


# Directive: debug-mode
#
# Description:
#     A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for
#     developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:
#
#     - The process will not detach from the controlling terminal
#
#     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail
#       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).
#
#     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and
#       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server
#       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is
#       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.
#
#     Setting this to 'off' when Zope is in a production environment is
#     encouraged, as it speeds execution (sometimes dramatically).
#
# Default: off
#
# Example:
#
#    debug-mode on


# Directive: http-realm
#
# Description:
#     The HTTP "Realm" header value sent by this Zope instance. This value
#     often shows up in basic authentication dialogs.
#
# Default: Zope
#
# Example:
#
#    http-realm Slipknot


# Directive: trusted-proxy
#
# Description:
#     Define one or more 'trusted-proxies' directives, each of which is a
#     hostname or an IP address.  The set of definitions comprises a list
#     of front-end proxies that are trusted to supply an accurate
#     X-Forwarded-For header to Zope.  If a connection comes from
#     a trusted proxy, Zope will trust any X-Forwarded header to contain
#     the user's real IP address for the purposes of address-based
#     authentication restriction.
#
# Default: unset
#
# Example:
#
#    trusted-proxy www.example.com
#    trusted-proxy 192.168.1.1


# Directive: security-policy-implementation
#
# Description:
#     The default Zope security machinery is implemented in C.  Change
#     this to "python" to use the Python version of the Zope security
#     machinery.  This setting may impact performance but is useful
#     for debugging purposes.  See also the "verbose-security" option
#     below.
#
# Default: C
#
# Example:
#
#    security-policy-implementation python


# Directive: skip-authentication-checking
#
# Description:
#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to skip checks related
#     to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.
#     Only works if security-policy-implementation is 'C'.
#
# Default: off
#
# Example:
#
#    skip-authentication-checking on


# Directive: skip-ownership-checking
#
# Description:
#     Set this directive to 'on' to cause Zope to ignore ownership checking
#     when attempting to execute "through the web" code. By default, this
#     directive is on in order to prevent 'trojan horse' security problems
#     whereby a user with less privilege can cause a user with more
#     privilege to execute dangerous code.
#
# Default: off
#
# Example:
#
#    skip-ownership-checking on


# Directive: verbose-security
#
# Description:
#     By default, Zope reports authorization failures in a terse manner in
#     order to avoid revealing unnecessary information.  This option
#     modifies the Zope security policy to report more information about
#     the reason for authorization failures.  It's designed for debugging.
#     If you enable this option, you must also set the
#     'security-policy-implementation' to 'python'.
#
# Default: off
#
# Example:
#
#    security-policy-implementation python
#    verbose-security on
