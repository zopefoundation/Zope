      This section describes the options for zopectl.  These options
      have no default value specified in the schema; in some cases,
      zopectl calculates a dynamic default, in others, the feature
      associated with the option is disabled.

      For those options that also have corresponding command-line
      options, the command line option (short and long form) are given
      here too.

        Command-line option: -d or --daemon.

        If this option is true, zdrun.py runs in the background as a
        true daemon.  It forks an child process which becomes the
        subprocess manager, while the parent exits (making the shell
        that started it believe it is done).  The child process also
        does the following:

        - if the directory option is set, change into that directory

        - redirect stdin, stdout and stderr to /dev/null

        - call setsid() so it becomes a session leader

         required="no" default="10">
      <description>
        Command-line option: -b or --backoff-limit.

        When the subprocess crashes, zdrun.py inserts a one-second
        delay before it restarts it.  When the subprocess crashes
        again right away, the delay is incremented by one second, and
        so on.  What happens when the delay has reached the value of
        backoff-limit (in seconds), depends on the value of the
        forever option.  If forever is false, zdrun.py gives up at
        this point, and exits.  An always-crashing subprocess will
        have been restarted exactly backoff-limit times in this case.
        If forever is true, zdrun.py continues to attempt to restart
        the process, keeping the delay at backoff-limit seconds.

        If the subprocess stays up for more than backoff-limit
        seconds, the delay is reset to 1 second.

        Command-line option: -f or --forever.

        If this option is true, zdrun.py will keep restarting a
        crashing subprocess forever.  If it is false, it will give up
        after backoff-limit crashes in a row.  See the description of
        backoff-limit for details.

    <key name="user" datatype="string"
         required="no">
      <description>
        Command-line option: -u or --user.

        When zdrun.py is started by root, this option specifies the
        user as who the the zdrun.py process (and hence the daemon
        subprocess) will run.  This can be a user name or a numeric
        user id.  Both the user and the group are set from the
        corresponding password entry, using setuid() and setgid().
        This is done before zdrun.py does anything else besides
        parsing its command line arguments.

        NOTE: when zdrun.py is not started by root, specifying this
        option is an error.  (XXX This may be a mistake.)

        XXX The zdrun.py event log file may be opened *before*
        setuid() is called.  Is this good or bad?

        If this option is true, the zdrun.py process will remain even
        when the daemon subprocess is stopped.  In this case, zopectl
        will restart zdrun.py as necessary.  If this option is false,
        zdrun.py will exit when the daemon subprocess is stopped

    <description>
      We need to specialize the database configuration section for Zope
      only by including a (required) mount-point argument, which
      is a string.  A Zope ZODB database can have multiple mount points,
      so this is a multikey.

      <description>
       The mount point is a slash-separated path to a 
       'Products.ZODBMountPoint.Mount.MountPoint' instance in Zope. If 
       such an instance exists, it can mount an object (the mounted 
       object) into Zope.
       By default, the object will be mounted at the same path in Zope (i.e.
       '/foo/bar' in the database will be mounted at '/foo/bar' in Zope).

       The object can be mounted at a different point using the
       'virtual_path:real_path' syntax (e.g.  'mount-point /foo/bar:/bar' 
       will mount the object at '/bar' in the database to '/foo/bar' in 
       Zope). The name of the mount point ('bar') must be the same as 
       the mounted object.

       It is also possible to specify the root that should be used in the
       mounted database by using the syntax
       'virtual_path:~real_root:real_path'. The root defaults to 'Application'
       and should not normally be changed.

  <key name="debug-mode" datatype="boolean" default="off">
    <description>
    A switch which controls several aspects of Zope operation useful for
    developing under Zope.  When debug mode is on:

     - Errors in product initialization will cause startup to fail
       (instead of writing error messages to the event log file).

     - Filesystem-based scripts such as skins, PageTemplateFiles, and
       DTMLFiles can be edited while the server is running and the server
       will detect these changes in real time.  When this switch is
       off, you must restart the server to see the changes.

     Set this directive to 'true' to enable the "MS-Author-Via" header
     in response to an OPTIONS WebDAV request. Early versions of
     Microsoft Web Folders and Microsoft Office require this header to
     be present to be able to connect to Zope via WebDAV.

     This is disabled by default since it makes a lot of standards-compliant
     things unhappy AND it tricks Microsoft Office into trying to edit Office
     files stored in Zope via WebDAV even when the user isn't allowed to edit
     them and is only trying to download them.

     Check this collector entry for more information:
     http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1441

     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January
     2005, do not require this header anymore, and instead require a
     "Public" header to be present in reply to the OPTIONS WebDAV
     request.

  <key name="enable-ms-public-header" datatype="boolean" handler="enable_ms_public_header" default="off">
     <description>
     Set this directive to 'on' to enable sending the "Public" header
     in response to an WebDAV OPTIONS request.

     Though recent WebDAV drafts mention this header, the original
     WebDAV RFC did not mention it as part of the standard. Very few
     web servers out there include this header in their replies, most
     notably IIS and Netscape Enterprise 3.6.

     Since many best practices documents out in the web mention
     turning off this header with the subject of "Mask Your Web Server
     For Enhanced Security", this setting is off by
     default. Presumably malicious people might take the presence of
     this header as indication of an IIS Web Server and try to attack
     your site, so be careful when turning it on.

     Recent versions of Microsoft Web Folders, updated after January
     2005, *do* require this header to be present in reply to the
     OPTIONS WebDAV request.

     Set this directive to 'off' in order to disable the autoquoting of
     implicitly retrieved REQUEST data by DTML code which contains a '&lt;'
     when used in &lt;dtml-var&gt; construction. When this directive is 'on',
     all data implicitly retrieved from the REQUEST in DTML (as opposed to
     addressing REQUEST.somevarname directly) that contains a '&lt;' will be
     HTML-quoted when interpolated via a &lt;dtml-var&gt; or &amp;dtml-
     construct. This mitigates the possibility that DTML programmers will
     leave their sites open to a "client-side trojan" attack.
