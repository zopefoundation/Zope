    This does two things:

    1. Make sure lines contain only strings, instead of bytes,
       or worse: a combination of strings and bytes.
    2. Replace deprecated ulines, utext, utoken, and ustring properties
       with their non-unicode variant, using native strings.

    See https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/987

    Since Zope 5.3, a lines property stores strings instead of bytes.
    But there is no migration yet.  (We do that here.)
    Result is that getProperty on an already created lines property
    will return the old value with bytes, but a newly created lines property
    will return strings.  And you might get combinations.

    Also since Zope 5.3, the ulines property type is deprecated.
    You should use a lines property instead.
    Same for a few others: utext, utoken, ustring.
    The unicode variants are planned to be removed in Zope 6.
