    Zope 2.2.4

      Bugs fixed

        - There was a mistyped permission in HelpSys.py ("Add Documents, 
          Files, and Images" should be "Add Documents, Images, and Files").

        - The caching code added for ImageFile objects had a dumb cut-n-paste 
          error (fixed for 2.2.4 final). ImageFile caching was verified 
          after the fix with the Cacheability Engine at:
	  http://www.web-caching.com/cacheability.html

        - Fixed and tested a problem in the way that headers are extracted 
          from the message text in the dtml-sendmail tag. Windows text 
          editors could introduce ^M characters that threw off the rfc822 
          message parser if they were not cleaned off before parsing.

    Zope 2.2.4 beta 1

      Bugs fixed

        - Zope 2.2.4 includes all of the 2.2.3 changes plus a fix 
          for a bug introduced while fixing another bug that caused 
          acquisition of permissions to fail (whew!). 

        - Fixed a bug in computation of object roles (from
          permissions) that could cause roles to come from
          non-containment context.

        - ImageFile objects (e.g. icons in the mgmt interface) did 
          not set or recognize HTTP caching headers, which caused 
          some browsers to never cache them.

        - The function rfc1123_date was mis-formatting http dates.

        - The registerHelp() method of ProductContext objects would 
          blow up if a product did not have a help directory.

    Zope 2.2.3

     Bugs fixed

        - Resolved known condition in the Catalog where objects are
          not guaranteed to be unindexed before indexing happens
	  again.  Now objects are guaranteed to be unindexed correctly
	  first.  This should resolve all outstanding KeyErrors with
	  Catalog, although currently broken Catalogs will require a
	  reindex to resolve them. 

        - Fixed a race condition and a possible memory leak in mounted
          databases.

        - Added the DTML Reference to the online help system.

        - Applied Toby Dickenson's patch that fixes aq_inContextOf.
          Now it is more thorough in discerning whether an object is in
          the context of another object.

        - Fixed keyword args for aq_acquire.

        - Plugged a memory leak that occurred when objects wrapped
          through acquisition but which do not have a "__call__"
          method are invoked.  The arguments passed to the call
          would be leaked.

        - DateTime did not recognize timezone strings like '+0200'.

        - Security for Images and Files could not be changed due to 
          an old name left in the permissions structure (__call__).

        - Removed some ancient references to Principia from the ZGadflyDA
          user interface.

        - Fixed bug in Client.py which opened filesystem file without
          using read-binary mode, which caused file corruption
          when uploading binary files using ZPublisher.Client
          from Windows NT.

        - The '_getOb' method of ObjectManagers did not correctly 
          restrict access to private attributes (beginning with an 
          '_').

        - The XML import/export machinery was fixed to properly deal
          with 'long' datatypes.

        - Uploading new contents for a File or Image object without a 
          content-type header caused the old (possibly now incorrect) 
          content_type attribute to be retained.

        - There was an extra slash in the rewrite rule for using PCGI
          in single-threaded mode in WEBSERVERS.txt

        - The PARENTS list passed to the validate method of User Folders 
          did not include the published object, which could lead to 
          incorrect security handling in certain cases (this was the 
          2000-10-02 Hotfix).

        - (Collector #1687) Products which register base classes
          for ZClasses typically defer creating them until product
          registration;  the derived ZClass needs them to be available
          immediately after import.  Deprecated
          'ProductContext.registerZClass' and
          'ProductContext.registerBaseClass' in favor of a new function,
          'ZClasses.createZClassForBase' (because none of the machinery
          needed a ProductContext instance anyway).  Update OFSP and
          ZCatalog products to use this machinery, instead of
          'registerBaseClass'.

        - The manage_edit of the Connection base class used by database 
          connection tried to coerce the connection string to an actual 
          string. This was problematic because some DAs (Sybase apparently) 
          store the connection string as an HTTPRequest.record object.

        - BASE tags generated by Zope were not XHTML compliant.

        - Part of the PropertyManager interface incorrectly assumed a 
          wrapped object.

        - HTTP date headers were generated by strftime in medusa; this 
          meant that using a different locale caused medusa to generate 
          invalide Date headers re: the RFC. The date header generation
          has been changed to use english even if a different locale is 
          in effect.

        - Dates generated by WebDAV code also used strftime and were 
          therefore made invalid when a non-english locale was in use.

        - Headings generated in HTML by StructuredText did not generate 
          a closing paragraph tag.

        - StructuredText did not recognize URLs with ampersands in them.

        - A bit of the SecurityManagement code expected threads to be 
          available, which broke the "single-threaded-mode" that some 
          folks use with pcgi.

        - DateTime arithmetic was broken if you tried to subtract a 
          DateTime from another DateTime where one of them was on 
          daylight savings time and the other was not.

        - The infamous "__call__" bug that could surface in situations 
          where documents called other documents has been stamped out. 
          And there was much rejoicing.

        - The redirect target after adding a ZSQLMethod had too many 
          path elements in it.

    Zope 2.2.2

      Bugs Fixed

        - Applied Dieter Maurers patch to prevent log entries from 
          being dropped when clients disconnect prematurely.

        - The manage_test method of database connection objects were 
          not checking for RDB-format results, which caused the test 
          queries to fail from the test tab of some older DAs.

        - Z2.py did not allow passing numeric UIDs for the -u option.

        - Fixed a bug in the dtml-var tag handling of the 'null'
          attribute. Before null would only work correctly if there was
          also a 'fmt' attribute. Now null correctly works with non-zero
          false values when there isn't a 'fmt' option.

        - Corrected a factory bug that prevented creation of ZClass
          instances within objects owned by users defined in a
          different user folder than the root acl_users.

        - Made ZopeAttributionButton method of Application object 
          public.

        - Factory dispatchers inappropriately acquired ownership in 
          certain cases, causing problems creating objects for users 
          not defined in the root user folder.

        - The DestinationURL method of FactoryDispatchers did not work
          correctly if the dispatcher was obtained through the 
          unrestrictedTraverse method.

        - Several calls to socket.bind() were fixed for Python 1.6/2.0
          compatibility in PCGI and Gadfly.

        - The sqlvar tag could fail on the trailing 'L' of the string
          representation of longs when coercing to int or float.

        - Under some circumstances, versions were only partially
          committed (or aborted) in FileStorages causing objects to be
          left locked in a version with no way to unlock them.

        - FileStorages opened read-only incorrectly truncated data
          files when incomplete transactions were discovered.

        - Read transactions were aborted due to conflict errors.
          This was an attempt to catch write conflicts early, but was
          far too pessimistic.

        - The document_src method of DTML objects required a REQUEST
          and RESPONSE argument, making it difficult to use from 
          Python code. They are now optional.

        - The "test" tab of SQL Methods did not include the rendered 
          query in the error message if the test failed due to a 
          database-level error (such as a malformed query).

        - A signed/unsigned buglet in the code for Splitter objects 
          caused recognition of national characters to fail on some 
          platforms (FreeBSD/x86).

        - A bug in ZODB database objects could cause ZEO clients to
          fail to start without deleting the ZEO client cache.

        - The 'lock' keyword argument to RESPONSE.redirect was not 
          in the API documentation.

        - Some missing SCRIPT_NAME variables were added to the IMG
          SRC paths for the navigator pane.

    Zope 2.2.1

      Bugs Fixed

        - Correction of ZClass-in-ZClass bugfix which prevented import of
          .zexp's containing Factories.

        - Made acquisition in the URL and XML-RPC work together.

        - A bug in FTP downloading was fixed.

        - A bug in the "views" screen for ZClasses could cause strange 
          IndexErrors depending upon whether help topics were created.

        - Improved behavior when non-persistent objects are added to an
          ObjectManager.

        - Fixed an obscure bug that could cause Zope to crash when
          there were errors in computed attributes that depended on
          acquisition.

        - Fixed very obscure bug in database invalidation when
          committing from one version to another. This could cause
          source version data to fail to get updated.

        - Fixed a condition that prevented error messages from
          being displayed when performing a redirect.  This means
          that standard_error_message documents that redirect now
          need to add a "lock=1" argument to the redirect call.

        - A bug in the stupid file logger consumed exception info
          for certain types of errors (such as failed product import).

        - A bug in integration with the new security machinery caused 
          copy / paste operations to fail in certain cases.

        - Changed permission assignments for 'manage_editForm', 'manage',
          'manage_main', 'manage_uploadForm', 'manage_historyCopy',
          'manage_beforeHistoryCopy' and 'manage_afterHistoryCopy' to 
          'Change DTML Documents' (for DTML Documents) and 'Change 
          DTML Methods' (for DTML Methods) which is more correct and 
          makes view filtering work properly.

        - The medusa code that produced the server log file was writing 
          the formatting the date in GMT but adding a local timezone 
          identifier (+0100, etc.) It has been fixed to format the date 
          using localtime.

        - The DTML "tree" tag did not understand the common shorthand 
          spellings for name= and expr=.

        - The HTML4 formatting method on DateTime objects did not return 
          the datetime in UTC as it was supposed to.

        - A bug in cgi.py caused an entire extra copy of large file 
          uploads and input data to be kept in memory, defeating the 
          work the module does to avoid doing exactly that ;^)

        - A bug in the cgi module could cause memory to spike on large 
          inputs, as it kept a complete copy of the input in memory 
          that was never used :(

        - A packing bug could cause data written by saved versions
          to be inaccessible. This is actually a bug that was fixed
          in Zope 2.1, but the fix never got applied to the main code
          tree. :(

        - The behavior of the tag and __str__ methods of images has 
          changed slightly; if no 'alt' argument is given, it will use 
          the title of the image (if defined) for the alt attribute. 
          Otherwise it will generate 'alt=""'. Also, it now generates 
          'border="0"' unless a different value for border is given as 
          a keyword argument.

        - The database control screen in the control panel did not
          work with storages that returned string "sizes". Some
          storages return strings to indicate units other than bytes.

        - Fixed the broken Product Help icon.

        - Fixed ZClass view help setting, thanks to Jeff Sasmor.

    Zope 2.2.1 beta 1
    
      Bugs Fixed

        - FileStorage-based databases became corrupted when their 
          size grew beyond 2GB.

        - FileStorage-based databases could be corrupted if
          transaction descriptions or transaction extended meta-data
          exceeded 64KB in size.

        - Some relational database adapters use an older version of 
          a results class in Shared.DC.ZRDB. The RDB-format based 
          results class was missing a needed security assertion to 
          allow access to result data.

        - Missing security assertions in the ZDOM module caused 
          unauthorized errors for things trying to use ZDOM (such 
          as XMLDocument).

        - A bug in the registration of help content caused unnecessary 
          transactions to be written at startup.

        - The machinery for guessing content types ignored default 
          values passed in explicitly.

        - A problem in the Find machinery removed the acquisition 
          context from subobjects, causing permission checking to 
          fail.

        - There was a hard-coded unix path separator in the logic 
          for initializing special dtml objects from files.

        - The ordering of tabs on some management screens was changed 
          inadvertantly during the 2.2 development cycle. The ordering 
          has been tweaked to conform more closely to earlier releases.

        - The strftime() method of DateTime objects was changed so that 
          it formats based on the current timezone representation of a 
          given DateTime object. This is now also the case when formatting 
          DateTimes from DTML using the fmt="..." construct (which uses 
          the strftime method under the hood). Previously, strftime 
          converted to GMT, which was inconsistent with other formatting 
          methods and caused problems for people. Those who actually do 
          want the date to be formatted in GMT can use: myDate.toZone('GMT') 
          to get a version of the object represented in GMT and then call 
          the formatting methods on that object.

        - Permissions were not properly defined for the new history
          vew in DTMLMethods and DTMLDocuments.  This caused many
          useful features to be available only to managers and others
          to be available only to those with undo priveledges.  A new
          permission, "View History" has been added for viewing
          historical changes and you can copy historical versions to
          the present if yo can edit DTMLDocuments or DTMLMethods.

        - The new traversal method, restrictedTraverse was private, 
          but should have been public. It also didn't check access to
          the root object when an absolute path was used.

        - The roles (and only the roles) "Manager" and "Anonymous"
          had the "Access contents information" permission on the root
          application object regardless of permission settings made
          through the management interface.

        - A ZCatalog bug which was symptomized by a "KeyError" during a
          searchResults query was squished by changing some exception
          handling in the cataloging machinery.

        - Version's chose their names based on absolute_url, which depends
          on access method, rather than physical path.

        - A fix for socket.connect() calls in preparation for Python 2.0 was 
          accidentally applied to a wrong part of Client.py in ZPublisher.

        - The "distribution" tab for ZClass-based products has been changed
          to allow creation of redistributable products.

        - DAV property sheets were not correctly associated with permissions, 
          which cause Unauthorized errors when iterating over propertysheets 
          under the new security model.

        - Some patches to PCGI added in the 2.2 development cycle to support 
          things like syslog connectivity were backed out due to problems 
          on certain platforms. The patches may make it back in the future 
          after the issues are resolved and broader platform testing can 
          be done.

        - The new security machinery did not allow REQUEST to be accessed
          when it was acquired. This didn't prevent access to REQUEST, but
          made the access eccessively expensive.

        - Fixed the display order of the Zope tutorial topics.

        - Fixed the help system menu frame to not use standard html
          header and footer.

        - Products that have not been updated to define an 'initialize' 
          method to do product initialization were not filtered correctly 
          by permission in the filtered object add list.

        - Exception logging was added to catalog to catch "shouldnt happen"
          sorts of events.

        - Text indexes did not recognize boolean connectives (and, not) 
          if they were mixed-case.

        - Fixed Tutorial bug that caused win98 to crash with adding a
          tutorial.

        - Fixed ZService.py to avoid overwriting existing service start 
          parameters at install time on win32.

        - The deprecated alias getSize() was added back to Image and DTML
          objects (existing products still depend on it).

        - Cleaned up a DocumentTemplate namespace issue.  Fixed QuickStart.

        - Removed old validation code in cDocumentTemplate.

        - In ZCatalog, it was possible for stemming on single-word search 
          queries to be handled incorrectly and produce no results.

        - A problem in the url traversal machinery caused strange errors 
          in cases where the root of the site was requested but had no 
          index_html instead of the expected Not Found error.

        - ZCatalog objects did not implement the searchable object 
          interface correctly.

        - XML (database) import sometimes failed, especially with
          ZClass instances.  

        - XML (database) export didn't properly handle strings that contained
          the string "\n".

        - The <base> tag insertion machinery failed if the request result 
          had content-type with a charset attribute (thanks to Dieter 
          Maurer).

        - A long-standing bug that caused a "resource not found" error when 
          trying to instantiate a ZClass inside of another ZClass was 
          fixed. Hooray for Chris McDonough :^)

        - In certain circumstances it was possible for the manage_afterAdd 
          and other manage_after* methods to get into an infinite loop by 
          essentially acquiring themselves in cases where subobjects did 
          not implement those protocols.

        - The sqlvar tag produced misleading error messages when an 
          expression caused an exception during rendering.

        - RFC1123 dates were not formatted correctly in the webdav.client 
          implementation.

        - Made the ObjectManager class inherit from Traversable (which
          exposes unrestrictedTraverse).  ObjectManager-type items which
          didn't inherit from SimpleItem.Item had problems with 
          Management.Tabs producing the right views for manage_options
          before this was in there.

        - FileStorage-based databases got into an unusable state if
          available disk space was exceeded.  This problem could
	  lead to database corruption.

    Zope 2.2.0
    
      Bugs Fixed

        - The add form for MailHost objects described fields that are 
          no longer needed (descriptions have been removed).

        - User databases did not correctly handle situations where a 
          browser sends an authentication token naming a user that 
          can't be found while accessing a publicly available resource.

        - Minor bug in ZCatalog which prevented deletion of indexes fixed.

        - XML-RPC requests could not be completed via https.

        - Several uses of multi-argument append() calls (that will be 
          illegal in Python 2.0) were fixed.

        - The UNLOCK method for DAV support was missing some needed 
          argument declarations.

	- Corrected some error handling in the database connection code.

        - Fixed support for strftime day-of-week formatting in DateTime.

        - Fixed Image content-type detection to also use the binary 
          "nonces" in the file to determine the real content-type.  This
          should catch GIF/JPEG/PNGs that are uploaded without the correct
          information associated with them.

        - Added missing permission declarations to make the methods of 
          PropertySheets objects accessible.

    Zope 2.2.0 beta 4
    
      Bugs Fixed

        - The History tab is now protected by the 'Undo changes' permission,
          and setting this permission actually has effect now.

        - A bug in validation in filtered_manage_tabs made tabs misbehave 
          in some cases.

        - Fix an AttributeError bug in the Lexicon objects used by ZCatalog.

        - FileUpload objects did not have the required security assertion
          to allow access to attributes such as filename and headers.

        - Broken objects weren't deletable due to a recent change in the
          object deletion logic added to support mountable databases.

        - Some formatting bugs in the status method of the ZServer HTTP 
          server were fixed (thanks to Jeff Rush).

        - The _read_data method of Image and File objects didn't correctly 
          handle being passed an actual file object.

        - A new behavior in 2.2 is that after calling REQUEST.redirect the 
          HTTP status can no longer be changed. This caused problems for 
          some people who were calling redirect() and then trying to set 
          the HTTP status to 301 Moved Permanantly instead of the default 
          302 Moved Temporarily status. To make this possible, a new 
          optional 'status' argument is now recognized by the redirect 
          method so that RESPONSE.redirect('/foo', status=301) can be 
          used

        - Corrected the text of some kinds of 'unauthorized' error messages.

        - Fixed a bug that caused dtml-try to throw a KeyError.  Related to
          the recent changes made to DT_Util.namespace().

        - Packing to a time earlier that a previous pack could
          lead to serious data lossage.

        - Attempts to install product information into the Zope database
          on startup made no sense and could cause problems for ZEO
          clients. Product adtabase updates are suppressed when the
          ZEO_CLIENT environment variable is set.

        - A missing security assertion made DTML code that tried to create 
          instances using manage_addProduct['foo'] constructs fail.

        - Fixed a couple typos in the Tutorial thanks to Alastair
          Burt.

        - Fixed a Javascript error in the Tutorial thanks to Luke
          Tymowski.

        - Revised online help content quite a bit.

        - Revised API docs quite a bit.

        - Fixed a bug in Logging docs thanks to Andy McKay.

        - Added code that will reveal bugs in calls to DT_Util.namespace().

        - The way that the values of selection and multiple selection 
          properties were looked up on the properties form was changed so 
          that the values can now be either properties on the same object 
          or found through the DTML '_' namespace to support situations 
          where the selection value is acquired or otherwise not findable 
          in the object's properties.

        - The If-Modified-Since handling in Image and File objects did not 
          gracefully handle malformed date strings in that header (which 
          seem to be sent by certain proxy servers). Malformed date strings 
          are now ignored as if the header was not present rather than 
          raising an error.

	- Corrected a recent problem with boolean properties.

        - Permissions were not being set properly on factory methods
          (constructors) loaded from Python (disk) products.  This bug
          existed in 2.1, but was not very visible until recent fixes
          were made to the security machinery.

        - The ownership management code incorrectly was willing to delete 
          ownership information in the class rather than only in object 
          instances.

        - A bug that made packing always complain that you were trying to 
          pack to an earlier time than a previous pack was fixed.

        - The security context stack wasn't handled correctly for
          DTMLDocuments.

        - DateTime objects did not support GMT(+/-)xx30 timezones.

    Zope 2.2.0 beta 3
    
      Bugs Fixed

        - Handling of "broken" products was, er, broken :) This is why 
          some folks reported seeing objects "spontaneously change into 
          Folders". In reality, the Broken objects that should have been 
          created in place of objects whose Product was missing or broken 
          weren't behaving correctly due to an interaction with the new 
          overridable __getattr__ support in cPersistence.

        - FTP support was broken for Folders containing Broken objects.

        - ZServer returned None as the HTTP version if no version was given 
          in the HTTP request.

        - It was possible to rename or move Versions, which was plain bad.

        - A bug that caused SQLMethods to have problems unpickling was fixed.
          This bug also made it impossible to add Zope Tutorial instances.

        - A bug in the lookup order for Product extensions was fixed.

        - Fixed the tutorial to ensure that a gadfly directory has been 
          created before attempting to import the tutorial info.

    Zope 2.2.0 beta 2
    
      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed Tutorial bug that caused win98 to crash with adding a
          tutorial.

        - Fixed ZService.py to avoid overwriting existing service start 
          parameters at install time on win32.

        - The deprecated alias getSize() was added back to Image and DTML
          objects (existing products still depend on it).

        - The "Host" headers sent by ZPublisher/Client.py did not include
          the port number if given.

        - Cleaned up a DocumentTemplate namespace issue.  Fixed QuickStart.

        - Removed old validation code in cDocumentTemplate.

        - Added checks to only allow legal Python name characters in ZClass 
          ids.

        - Selection and multiple selection properties were displayed 
          incorrectly on ZClass propertysheet forms.

        - getPropertyType was not supported for PropertySheet objects. It 
          appeared to work but always returned None because it was being 
          acquired :)

        - The 'send' method of MailHost objects was broken if explicit 
          to, from or subject arguments were given.

        - The constructor for MailHost objects was changed to have a non-
          backward compatible signature in the alpha period. The 'localhost' 
          and 'timeout' arguments were added back to the MailHost constructor 
          for backward code compatibility for 2.2 beta 2 (though these args 
          are now effectively ignored).

        - An insufficiently protected method deep in DocumentTemplate was 
          fixed to prevent a security issue that could allow unauthorized 
          changes to the sources of DTML objects.

        - Insertion of the BASE tag in responses violated the HTML 4 spec, 
          which states that BASE must come first in the <head> element of 
          a document so that relative references thereafter will work. It 
          now conforms to the spec.

        - A bug in the SendMail tag if an existing mailhost was named has 
          been fixed.

        - New and improved content has been added to the help system.

        - Some problems with certain management screens having wrong help 
          or no help have been fixed.

        - A bug in PropertyManager allowed properties defined in products 
          as read-only to be changed.

        - Added an entry in the content_types registry for RealAudio file 
          extensions.

        - At some point z2.py stopped accepting "-P 0" as a valid option. 
          That has been fixed.

        - Fixed a bug that caused instances of ZClasses which use
          DTMLMethod as a base class to have an ID of "<string>".
          Unfortunately, existing instances will still have the wrong
          ID.  The effect is it's not possible to use the clipboard on
          them.  They will need to be re-created.

	- Fixed a bug in PermissionMapping that could in a certain case 
          cause determination of whether an object is a ZClass instance 
          method to throw an exception.

        - A few tweaks were needed to the way that SQLMethods made use of 
          the new security machinery. This fixes the authorization problems 
          some users were seeing when calling SQLMethods from inside of 
          other SQLMethods.

        - Medusa did not handle absolute URLs given in HTTP commands quite 
          correctly. It turns out that WebTV (and possibly others) send 
          such commands, and the HTTP spec allows them, so we now support 
          it.

    Zope 2.2.0 beta 1
    
      Features Changed

        - Split the old CHANGES.txt into two files. CHANGES.txt will 
          now contain only change information for the current Zope 
          release. Change information for older versions is now in 
          the file HISTORY.txt.

        - Added basic internal support for mountable databases. A separate 
          product will still be required to make use of this ability.

        - Added a new "history" tab to selected objects (DTML methods and
          documents for now) that provides access to previous versions 
          through the web.

        - The property management screens now include the types for
          existing properties.

        - Added support at Python level for user-defined
          __get/set/delattr__ methods on persistent objects. These
          have essentially the same semantics as for Python, except
          that overridden __set/delattr__ methods must explicitly
          signal changes that should be persistent.

        - Better error messages and syslog capabilities were added to 
          pcgi-wrapper (thanks to Jeff Rush).

        - Calls to the ZLogger system were added to the user authentication
          process to help sys admins diagnose login problems (thanks again
          to Jeff Rush).

        - The Undo view shows *only* transactions performed in the
          place where undo was performed. (As before, it also
          shows only transactions performed by users defined in the
          place where the undo user is defined.)

        - The way that transaction logging is done was changed to make
          transaction logs based on "physical" object and user
          paths. This was necessary to make undo work properly in the
          presense of virtual hosts.

        - A number of hooks have been added and changes made to
          support products that implement virtual hosts. Keep an eye on
          http://www.zope.org/Members/michel/Projects/Interfaces/ImplementingVirtualHosts

        - The distributions now have an Extensions directory by default.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added type checking to the constructor and edit methods of
          builtin Zope object types to prevent inappropriate passing
          of acquisition-wrapped objects for standard attributes (like 
          title, etc.). A similar restriction was added to prevent the
          adding of wrapped objects as properties.

        - Fixed a naming bug in MailHost that caused simple_send to
          fail.

        - Fixed a buglet in the rename form that caused the form to submit
          to the old manage_renameObject if the user just hit the enter 
          key in the browser on a single item rename.

        - A bug that caused the tabs to disappear after performing cache
          management operations was fixed.

        - A problem that prevented multiple Zope instances from running 
          at the same time on win32 was fixed.

        - An algorithm in medusa's max_sockets.py code was updated to 
          improve startup time on certain platforms.

        - The behavior of manage_editProperties on PropertyManagers and
          PropertySheets has been fixed so that existing properties that
          are not found in the update request are not reset to empty 
          values.

        - A problem that disallowed access to the individual records in 
          a result set from a SQL method was fixed.

        - A problem that caused the query template for an SQL method to
          be rendered twice when used from the "test" tab has been fixed.

        - Fix for bug #1270: Netscape Image Problems. Added casts to long 
          to avoid an overflow error caused when trying to convert dates 
          sent by certain versions of Netscape in the If-Modified-Since 
          header.

        - Corrected DateTime.py to recognize years specified as 00 through
          69 as 2000 through 2069.

        - A bug that made objects named in dtml namespaces always fail 
          security validation was fixed. This was noticed by folks trying
          to use manage_tabs from ZClasses who hit the bug because the
          manage_tags document uses a namespace: 
          <dtml-with "_(manage_options=...">

        - A change to pcgi_publisher was made to support FreeBSD, where
          send() will send only 8192 bytes at a time.

        - A bug that broke import in the alpha was fixed.

        - A bug in the transaction handling logic could cause infinite
          loops if objects were registered incorrectly.

        - A bug in the transaction machinery could cause objects to
          be aborted multiple times if errors occurred.

        - Logging via syslog now correctly captures the process id.

        - Adding User Folders and MailHosts from the management screens 
          didn't redirect to the correct URL after adding the object.

        - A form problem that prevented joining or leaving versions 
          has been fixed.

        - A more reasonable default content type is now used for HEAD 
          requests on DTML objects if the object does not have a 
          content_type attribute or a file-extension-like id that can 
          be used to determine content type.

        - HTTP HEAD handling was inconsistent for collections, depending
          on whether the "default document" (index_html) was acquired or
          not.

    Zope 2.2.0 alpha 1

      Features Changed

        - Added a new security policy architecture and object ownership 
          to address the server side trojan issue. The new architecture
          cleaned up various places where Zope code did authorization
          checks. A side effect of the new policy is that it is a bit
          more strict than it used to be - objects without explicit
          protection to which access was previously allowed will now
          be denied. There is a new declarative method for providing
          access to such objects, which has been applied to certain 
          previously unprotected Zope objects that DTML writers are 
          accustomed to having access to. See the SecurityPolicy 
          wiki pages on Zope.org for further information.

        - Added a new online help system. Help is now available for
          standard Zope objects. Zope developers can add help for their
          Python Products and Control Panel Products. See HELPSYS.txt

        - Added logic to increase the Python interpreter "check interval"
          that should provide at least a 20% performance improvement for 
          most Zope sites. Also added a new -i option to z2.py so that
          Zope users can pass in alternate values (the default is 120)
          for the check interval. This lets users experiment and tune
          the interval for the best results in their particular system
          environments.

        - The message returned when an empty result set is returned
          from a ZSQL Method has been clarified.

        - In the load_site utility:

           o Added logic to try and figure out a path to ZPublisher if
             one was not provided.
             
           o Added an option, -I, to automatically add an index_html
             method that redirects to index.html or index.htm.
        
        - Record objects returned by ':record' form-marshalling tag have
          been enhanced to act like mapping objects.

        - The ZServer startup script, z2.py, now allows all servers to be
          disabled with a single option,

        - The ZServer startup script, z2.py, now allows all multiple
          HTTP, FTP, or monitor servers to be run.

        - The ZServer startup script, z2.py, now allows separate IP
          addresses to be specified for each HTTP, FTP, or monitor
          server. 

        - Added 'urlparam' attribute to tree tag to allow propagation
          of extra parameters through tree URL's (Collector #1045).

        - When renaming objects, the old id is provided as the 
          default value for the new id.

        - Allow non-sliceable keys in PersistentMappings (Collector #1064).

        - Use smtplib in implementing MailHost/sendmail (Collector #1005).

        - Allow call to get() w/o explicit default in PersistentMapping
          (Collector #1182).

        - Allow rename of multiple items (Collector #1065).

        - Allow expr syntax in <dtml-mime/boundary> for type, disposition,
          encode, name, filename; add skip_expr (Collector #892).

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed problem with extra PermissionMapping objects being in
          the aq_parents hierarchy during traversal when a method was
          being accessed a ZClass defined instance method.

        - Fixed ZCatalog 'Find to ZCatalog' with expressions problem.

        - Fixed broken links in ZCatalog 'Cataloged objects' view.

        - FTP directory listings were not sorted.

        - Improved FCGI support in ZServer.

        - Improved ZServer streaming, including fixing chunking and
          keep-alive support. Chunking is now done by default with
          HTTP 1.1 clients. Fixed possible problems with large responses.
          Thanks to Toby Dickenson.

        - ZServer's FTP server no longer binds to all interfaces.

        - Fixed a bug which caused File objects of type 'text/html' be
          have the wrong Content-Length set.

        - A bug in SQL methods could caused results to be returned without
          an acquisition context.  This could cause methods provided
          via ZClass brains to be inaccessable due to the dependence of
          ZClass method security on a correct acquisition environment.

        - Fixed tree tag so that expand_all and branches_expr play nice
          (Collector #919).

        - Suppressed "private" names from catalog indexes/meta-data
          (Collector #1076).

        - Allowed strings with linebreaks as data in Gadfly queries
          (Collector #972).

        - Added note to WEBSERVER.txt pointing out security issues with
          REMOTE_USER mode (Collector #733).

        - Fixed colspan counting in tree tag (Collector #913).

        - Logging enabled with the -D option to the z2.py script did
          not include traceback information and was not performed
          during Zope startup.  This made finding startup errors
          difficult.

        - The logic for reparsing the dtml files used for the Zope management
          screens while in development mode was broken - it was reparsing 
          system dtml files on every request.

        - Correct DateTime docstring to remove spurious 'negative offset'
          language (Collector #1074).

        - Clean up pointer cast to suppress compiler warning in zlib.c
          (Collector #1190).

        - Guarantee null-terminated buffer in Record_init() so
          Record_compare() doesn't UMR (Collector #1012).

        - Clean up use of PData for large images (Collector #1061).

        - Fix overflow exception in statistics of <dtml-in> (Collector #1089).

        - Check for invalid characters in whole id, not just first character
          (Collector #1131).

        - Prevent unintentional exceptions from blocking manage_beforeDelete;
          added OFS.ObjectManager.BeforeDeleteException to allow an object
          to veto its deletion (Collector #1183).


    Zope 2.1.6

      Bugs Fixed

        - Some bits from the 2.2 line inadvertantly got into the ZRDB
          package during the SQL Methods update which caused errors 
          for certain database adapters.

        - A fix to the logic in Acquisition for aq_acquire caused a bug 
          in the handling of inner ZClasses.


    Zope 2.1.5

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a problem with the permission declarations for the Image 
          and File classes. The problem made it impossible to change the 
          'View' permission for File objects.

	- Added logic to setgid() to the user's primary group if z2.py
          is run by root.

        - Fixed a bug in TimeStamp objects that produced a wrong 
          date/time representation for bobobase_modification_time.

        - Changed _checkId in ObjectManager to disallow REQUEST as an
          object id.

        - Fixed a bug that could allow someone with a lot of Zope zen
          to change the apparent AUTHENTICATED_USER to access things 
          that they shouldn't.

        - Fixed a bug in ZServer that could cause server hangs under
          certain heavy load conditions.

        - Fixed a remaining '.' form target that we missed in the Zope
          rename form. This caused rename to fail for Zope installations 
          running behind Netscape servers.

        - Fixed a potential buffer bug in PCGI reported by Larry Luther.

        - In the load_site utility, binary files were misshandled on
          windows.

        - Fixed manage_renameObject to be willing to get the REQUEST 
          via acquisition, making it easier to use from DTML.

	- Changed the expireCookie method of FTPResponse to fail 
          gracefully when attempting to delete a cookie that does
          not exist.

        - Fixed a bug that caused a traceback when all members of a 
          multiple select property were deselected.

	- The _validTime method of DateTime objects rejected time values
          with fractional seconds between 59 and 60 (which caused problems
          with some database date conversions).

        - Changed id checking logic to disallow '/' in an object id.

        - Structured Text had problems with '~' characters in URLs.

        - Fixed a potential security hole that could allow users with 
          permission to add Folders and edit DTML (and a who have a 
          lot of Zope zen) to get access to things that they shouldn't.
          
        - The internal templates used by SQL methods weren't correctly 
          applying the same access control constraints as standard DTML
          objects.

	- Fixed ZopeAttributionButton to open in the top-level of the
          web browser.

        - Fixed a problem with using the "scale" arguments to the tag
          method of Image objects.

        - Fixed a problem in the Acquisition module that could cause
          objects accessed via aq_acquire to not be wrapped correctly.

        - Fixed If-Modified-Since header handling for Images and Files.


    Zope 2.1.4

      Bugs Fixed 

        - Removed the "feature" that allowed the REQUEST object to be
          traversed through the web. While useful for debugging, this 
          could be a security issue.


    Zope 2.1.3

      Bugs Fixed 

        - A race condition in the logic for managing Zope database
          connections caused Zope to hang on very busy sites.

	- A bug in the packing code that caused records to be
          nreadable after:

	  o  someone did work in a version

	  o  Someone did an (unrelated) undo

	  o  the version was committed

	  and the database was packed to a time before the work was done
	  in the version. 

	- Fixed a bug that caused packing to raise an
	  error in the following situation:

	    o someone modifies and then deletes an object
	      in a version.

	    o they commit the version

	    o the database is packed between the time the
	      object is deleted and the time the version
	      is committed.

        - Fixed a bug that caused Zope to sometimes hang instead of
          shutting down or restarting when accessed over a fast network. 

        - It wasn't possible to use a ZClass instance as a method of a
          ZClass. 


    Zope 2.1.2

      Bugs Fixed 

        - Thanks to Kevin Littlejohn's sleuthing, a sizable problem in
	  the security machinery in DTML has been brought to our
	  attention and resolved.  The problem is most acute in
	  situations where untrusted people can edit DTML documents or
	  methods.


    Zope 2.1.1

      Bugs Fixed 

        - Conflict errors (multiple threads trying to modify the same
          object) were not handled correctly for requests with
          bodies (e.g. POST requests).

        - ZODB FileStorage index files could become out of date after
          an undo. This could lead to strange results and apparent
          database corruption if Zope was shut down ungracefully and
          restarted.  Now index files are removed when undoing
          records.

        - Saving or discarding versions failed if a transaction that
          added a new object in the version was undone.

        - There was circumstantial evidence that a failure of an OS to
          correctly delay writing to data to disk after Zope had
          written it led to a corrupted database.  Zope now makes an
          'fsync' system call (where available on Unix systems) to
          force data to be written to phusical storage when
          transactions are committed.

        - Some applicataions were writing empty transactions. The
          FileStorage now checks for and avoids writing empty
          transactions in this case.

        - Multiple-selection properties didn't work in regular
          property views, even though they did work in ZClass property
          sheets.

        - The Win32 WISE installer did not create a default Zope.cgi
          PCGI resource file.

        - The Win32 WISE installer script is now included in the /inst
          directory of win32 installations by popular demand.

        - An import problem caused the name "BTree" to be incorrectly 
          overwritten in TextIndex.py and UnTextIndex.py in the
          SearchIndex package, which caused problems for some third-
          party product authors.

        - There were a number of problems with the load-site utility
          (utilities/load_site.py):

           o A recent change caused HTML files to have their headers and
             footers replaced with var tags for standard headers and
             footers.  While this is sometimes very useful, it is
             sometimes disastrous.  This feature is now enabled with the
             -D option.
             
           o Handling of files with a '.dtml' extension was broken. These
             are now handled correctly. Files with '.dtml' suffixes now
             get uploaded as methods.
             
           o A workaround for old sites that had a bug in Document (aka
             DTMLMethod) upload has been disabled. This workaround is now
             enabled when the -9 option is used.

      The following bug fixes were accidentially excluded from 2.1.0:

        - Redefining the "views" on a ZClass could incorrectly affect
          the views available on instances of base classes of the ZClass.

        - The new 'url' option to DTML 'var' tags did not work properly
          for DTML and other callable objects.


    Zope 2.1.0
    
      Features Changed
      
        - Enabled preliminary support for FastCGI to ZServer. This
          allows Zope to communicate with web servers that support
          FastCGI. Use z2.py's -F switch to configure FastCGI support
          in ZServer. See WEBSERVER.txt for more information.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Redefining the "views" on a ZClass could incorrectly affect
          the views available on instances of base classes of the ZClass.

        - The new 'url' option to DTML 'var' tags did not work properly
          for DTML and other callable objects.


    Zope 2.1.0 beta 2

      Features Added

        - Added Oleg Broytmann's patches to utilities/load_site.py 
          that provide automatic parsing of title and property 
          information and inclusion of std headers and footers.

        - Added Martijn Pieters' patches to DT_Try.py to implement 
          try/except/else and try/finally constructs.

        - Virtual Hosting and SiteObjects.  Virtual Hosting allows a
          server that can multi-host, like Apache, to serve different
          hosts from different Zope folders.  'SiteObjects' act as a
          placeholder for a virtualhost.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Some problems with the product distribution machinery that
          prevented product distributions from installing correctly 
          have been fixed.

        - Description lines on the Undo screen were not HTML quoted,
          which could cause problems rendering the Undo log if any 
          of the descriptions contained stray HTML tags.

        - Bugs in the way that ZClass instances were pickled have 
          been fixed.

        - Some long-standing indentation problems with the tree tag 
          have been fixed.

        - The Zope database lock file was not properly closed.
 
        - Linux and Solaris binary distributions did not contain the
          python _locale module required for locale support.


    Zope 2.1.0 beta 1

      Features Added

        - The ZCatalog now supports relevance ranking.  Instead of
          search results being returned in an essentially random
          order, results are now sorted by 'score'.  For text indexes, 
          the score is the number of occurrences of the search term in 
          a document.  The score can be accessed by an attribute on
          Catalog results 'data_record_score_' and
          'data_record_normalized_score_' contain the score and
          normalized score for the result object.

        - Added Keyword Indexes to the Catalog.  Keyword indexes allow
          you to index a sequence of 'keywords' as an atomic property
          of an object.  This is useful for buiding catagorical
          hierarchies.

        - Z SQL Methods arguments list is now a TEXTAREA widget to
          ease editing long aruments lists.

        - SQL Database Adapters now have a 'test' tab where arbitrary
          SQL may be entered and executed immediately through the
          connection object.  DTML is not supported in this tab.

        - SQL Methods now support an option 'op' parameter on the DTML 
          method <dtml-sqltest> which allows you to choose the
          operator used for comparison. 

        - WebDAV support has been modified to support MS Office 2000
          applications. The changes _emulate_ aspects of DAV level 2
          locking but do _not_ provide actual locking support at the
          present time.

        - Files and Images now can be served without loading themselves
          into memory. This is automatically done for large Files and 
          Images. As a by product, RESPONSE.write now works better in
          ZServer.

        - Most if not all of the default DTML generated by Zope and its
          built-in products is now generated in the new <dtml-var ...>
          syntax. The DTML sources for Zope's built-in management 
          interfaces have also been converted to the new syntax.

        - DTML entity references can now include dot-separated
          var tag *options*, as in: '&dtml.url_quote-foo;'

        - There is a new 'url' option on the DTML var tag that causes
          absolute_url to be called on the displayed value.  This
          allows entity references like: '&dtml.url-foo;'

        - There is a new 'url_quote_plus' option on the DTML var tag that
          acts like the standard url_quote option but uses '+' to encode
          blank spaces.

        - There is a new 'missing' option in the DTML var tag that
          allows you to provide a value to be used if the variable is
          missing, rather than raising a KeyError.  This will work in
          the entity reference syntax as well.  If it is used without
          an argument, it will provide an empty string.

        - The DTML built-in function, getattr, now accepts an additional 
          argument providing a default value.    

        - The tag() method of Image objects now support optional 'scale',
          'xscale' and 'yscale' arguments that will automatically scale 
          the output height and width tag attributes.

        - The Products folder in the Control Panel now has an 'Import/Export'
          tab to allow easier importing and exporting of Control Panel
          Products.

      Features Changed

        - ZCatalog uses subtransactions to keep memory consuption low
          at the expense of indexing speed.  Subtransactions can now
          be disabled through the management interface for use with
          non subtransactions compatible objects like ZSQL Methods (or
          for raw speed if you have lots of RAM).

        - Added a coptimizations module.  The first optimization is
          to provide an implementation of persistent_id in C.  This
          routine, which is called extremely often while pickling was
          found to be a significant bottleneck.

        - More flexible cache management methods were added to ZODB
          Connection objects so that apps that want to move objects
          out of memory can force aggressive cache behavior.

        - Added the beginnings of internationalization support to Zope.
          The Zope startup script (z2.py) now supports a "-L" option 
          that can be used to pass a locale name (such as "en" or "de")
          to Zope at startup. If specified, Zope will attempt to set the
          locale using the locale module if it is available. This change
          will allow Zope to better handle international characters in
          a number of places such as searching and indexing.

        - Logging from ZServer modified to produce Common Log Format
          in a Combined format, where user-agent and referer are also 
          logged.
          
        - xmlrpclib was updated to relect the current version (0.9.8)
          from Pythonware.

        - Add button returned to the management interface, although
          the Javascript auto-select is still in place.  This resolves 
          some problems with browsers on certain platforms.

        - Added small explanation on Image/File add form that if the
          'id' is not provided, it will be autogenerated based on the
          file name.

      Bugs Fixed

        - The build procedure for source checkouts now sets the
          directory structure permissions to something (775) readable
          by anyone, including, e.g., the web server running under a
          different user id and group than the installer...

        - A bug in the DTML tree tag that prevented expand_all from
          working correctly has been fixed.

        - ZCatalog now actually saves memory when using
          subtransactions.  Plugged a couple memory leaks doing this.

        - Added ALT text fixed nested anchor tags produced by the Tree
          tag to ensure that valid HTML is produced, and fixed the
          reverse option to the Tree tag.

        - A bug in FTP cookie authentication was fixed.

        - Fixed a bug that caused External Methods to be reloaded every
          time they were used in development mode.

        - Fixed a permission typo in ZCatalog and a sort_on bug.

        - Fix for missing REQUEST in a method signature in the 
          CatalogAwareness module.

        - Changed to propagate errors raised by _begin for thunked
          database adapters. Also changed completion code to check 
          registered status and avoid completion logic if not registered, 
          which would be the case if _begin failed.

        - A memory leak in cPersistence has been fixed, and a bug in
          object deactivation that prevented deactivation of BTrees
          was fixed.

        - A problem in BTrees that caused unintended db writes on 
          Catalog searches was fixed.

        - Some unnecessary debug mode overhead eliminated - external
          methods are now automatically reloaded only when the .py
          files are changed. 

        - A thread-safety problem with PCGI handling was fixed.

        - A bug that caused installation of through-the-web product
          distributions to fail.

        - A bug in the handling of long int properties was fixed.

        - Some bugs in the generation and verification of CRYPT based 
          passwords was fixed.

        - A bug in the earliestTime method of DateTime objects was fixed.

        - A bug in determination of the ZServer version string was fixed.

        - Height and width detection for some PNG images did not work 
          properly.

        - A bug that caused proxy role machinery to ignore local roles
          was fixed.

        - Added a fix for PCGI to make sure binary IO is used on win32.

        - A javascript fix for IE5 was made for the folder add list.

        - A bug in sequence multiplication in DTML was fixed.

        - A ZServer bug that prevented running multiple Zope2 installations 
          on non-posix systems was fixed.

        - An External Method error handling bug was fixed.

        - The local 'Owner' role could be overwritten when an object
          was copied, moved or renamed.

        - Documented and fixed the creation of 'selection' and 'multiple
          selection' properties.

        - SECURITY: Fixed bug that allowed users with local roles gain 
          priviledges on acquired objects.  getRolesInContext did not 
          used the correct context, as defined by the inner-most object 
          wrapping.

        - SECURITY: The permissions for Find support methods were not 
          being properly initialized.

        - SECURITY: Viewing existing user no long displays current password,
          only space for putting in the new password. This will be more
          critical as we move toward fully encrypted passwords.

        - SECURITY: A bug that prevented setting permissions on External 
          Methods in ZClasses was fixed.


    Zope 2.0.1

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a bug which allowed unauthorized options to be displayed 
          when adding a Folder. Now you only see options to add an 
          index_document and/or a user folder if you have adequate 
          permissions.


    Zope 2.0

      Features Added

        - Database conflict errors are now logged.  Although conflict
          errors are normally handled by retrying requests, frequent
          conflict errors can degrade performance and should be dealt
          with by redesigning applications.

      Features Changed

        - The process id displayed in the control panel now inclused
          the thread id, in parentheses.

        - Upload of image or file data *always* used
          sub-transactions. Unfortunately, database adapters don't
          support subtransactions.  Images and files now use
          subtransactions only of the image or file is greater than
          128K bytes in size.  Also, subtransactions are not used if
          data are uploaded as a string by using the ':string'
          ZPublisher type in the upload form.

          More advanced DA's could, and probably should support
          sub-transactions.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Attempting to cut an object then paste it into itself or
          one of its subobjects would cause a recursion problem.

        - Certain ZCatalog reindex operations could fail due to an
          unintended transaction abort.

        - Database connections were leaked when database conflict
          errors occurred and handled by reexecuting requests.  When 7
          connections leaked, the site would accept no more web
          requests. 

        - The transaction-integration for relational databases didn't
          work properly.  Aborting Zope transactions didn't abort
          relational database transactions. What's worse, transactions
          were not committed after a Zope transaction using a
          relational database was aborted.  This explains the reported
          problems with Gadfly databases and transactions.

        - Fixed a bug which prevented ZPublisher.Client from uploading
          files to ZServer.

        - Added some logic to the win32 binary installer to fix some
          dll loading problems people were getting on international
          versions of NT.

        - Fixed a bug in cDocumentTemplate that could cause AttributeError
          instances to be leaked in certain situations.

        - 'reverse' option for the 'in' tag as well as the 'tree' tag
          has been changed to deal with a copy of the data, rather
          than the original.  The database was being modified in
          place. The side effect is that in large list situations
          (with ZCatalog for example), sizable memory usage may
          result. 

        - Missing values (as returned from SQL methods) were output as
          empty strings by the DTML var tag, even when a numeric
          format (e.g. "%5.3f") is used.  Using a numeric format with
          a missing value should generate an error, unless the null
          attribute is used. Also, the null attribute had no effect
          when outputing missing values.

        - It was impossible to map some permissions to themselves, or
          to other inherited, but not registered permissions in
          products and in class methods.  When this failed, a silly
          error message ("Waaa" ;) was output.

        - SQL methods had an unused method, getFindContent allowed
          anonymous users to read SQL method source.  This method was
          renamed to PrincipiaSearchSource, and protected with a
          permission.

        - SQL methods could not be found with the find mechanism by
          searching their source.

        - The PrincipiaSearchSource method of DTML documents and
          methods was not protected, so anonymous users could read
          their source.

        - Fixed a bug in ZOM which caused getElementsByTagName to fail
          when using XML Document. Thanks to Andrew Kuchling.

        - It was possible to hijak 'self' arguments for DTML and
          External methods with request variables. This was especially
          problematic for XML-RPC, which uses positional arguments.

        - It was difficult or impossible to call External methods with
          'self' arguments from XML-RPC.
        

    Zope 2.0 beta 6

      Features Added

        - The control panel process id display now also includes the
          thread id.

        - The Zope start script, 'start', is now written in a
          location-independent manner, making it a little easier to
          move Zope sites around after installation.

      Features Changed

        Zope 2.0 introduces a new HTML DTML syntax that, among other
        things, allows simple 'var' tags to be entered using the
        entity-reference syntax, as in::

          <input name=spam value="&dtml-spam;">

        The entity reference syntax is mainly intended for use
        when a var tag is used to insert text into an HTML tag.  In
        these cases, the text needs to be html-quoted. For this
        reason, use of the entity reference syntax now implies html
        quoting. For example, the DTML snippet above is equivalent to::

          <input name=spam value="<dtml-var spam html_quote>">

        (Note that when inserting text to be used in a URL, as in an A
        tag HREF attribute, we need to url-quote the text. Zope 2.1
        will provide a means to do this with the entity-reference
        syntax.)

      Bugs Fixed

        - Missing values were not formatted correctly with numeric
          formats and did not work properly with the 'null' attribute of
          the DTML 'var' tag.

        - It wasn't possible to map some permissions of objects in
          Products. For example, it wasn't possible to enable a
          permission by mapping it to itself.  Attempts to do so lead
          to a rather silly uninformative error message.

        - When providing default values for input fields, few of the
          built-in DTML methods used html quoting.  This lead to
          incorrect behavior when default values included markup or
          quotes.  

        - View filtering failed to show tabs for views in some cases
          where it should.

        - Single-character variable names were'nt allowed in the
          entity-reference DTML syntax.

        - DTML batch processing didn't work properly.

        - The DTML functions, '_.getattr', and '_.hasattr' incorrectly
          acquired attributes even when explicit acquisition was used.

        - Image dimensions were not autodetected for PNG 1.2 files.

        - The "View" view didn't display correctly for images with ids
          with characters that had special meaning in URLs.

        - The 'optional' attribute in the 'sqltest' tag had no effect.

        - With browsers (like lynx) that correctly implement RFC 1867
          for file-upload support, non-file fields in file-upload
          requests were treated as file fields.


    Zope 2.0 beta 5
    
      Features Removed

       - The help system, which was primarily geared to DTML
         programmers was removed.

      Bugs fixed

        - Database packing failed in certain cases where the data set
          contained many version commits.

        - Database packing generated spurious error logs indicating
          that there were bad references for objects created in
          ncommitted versions.

        - A memory leak due to errors in managing request data.

        - Zope sites became unresponsive (a.k.a. "Hung") due to an
          error in managing ZODB 3 database connections.

        - Only the top-level folder's standard_error_message was used.

        - There were thread-safety and resouce consumption problems
          in the implementation of thread-safe regex objects.
         
        - Fixed bug where ZCatalog's not in the root folder did not
          recognize the proper URL of objects using the 'Find'
          machinery.  This caused all the objects to mysteriously
          disapear when you updated the catalog (because their paths
          were wrong).  The Catalog now works correctly anywhere in
          the object hierarchy.

        - Fixed a bug that caused error messages to be formatted
          incorrectly if the standard_html_header did not begin
          with an HTML tag.

        - The undo form was accessible even to people who couldn't do
          undo. This made it look like we were allowing undo in cases
          where we were'nt supposed to.

        - The undo form did not restrict undoable transactions to
          just those transactions performed by users that were 
          authenticated at the same level.  This made the new undo
          less restrictive than the Zope 1 undo.  Undo should probably
          be *more* restrictive, but that will have to wait for 2.1
          or later.

        - Zope crashed under load for applications using ZCatalog due
          to an ancient bug in handling loading of empty BTrees from
          the database.  This bug has only become effective with
          ZCatalog.


    Zope 2.0 beta 4
    
      Features Removed

        - Draft objects are no longer supported.

      Features added

        - The source release install script now checks to make sure that
          the Python used has thread support.

        - FileStorages can now habe quotas.

      Bugs fixed

        - This release fixes a socket listen-queue depth problem on
          Win32 systems that caused poor performance and connection
          refusals in ZServer.

        - Fixes to the win32 installation were made to prevent a
          potential conflict on systems that have an existing
          installation of the Python win32 extensions.

        - Some of the management views, including the
          security/permission mapping views were not visible for
          ExternalMethods. 

        - New SQL methods could bot be created.

        - New mailhost objects could not be created.

        - New Draft objects could be created.

        - Draft objects could not be deleted.

        - ZClasses could not be added as methods.
 
        - Disk full errors could leave the object system
          in an inconsistent state.  The handling of this error 
          was made more robust.  Also, when serious errors like this
          occur late in the transaction commit process, the
          transaction system switches to read-only mode.

          The File-storage recovery process needs to change to make
          disk full errors detectable earlier in the two-phase commit
          process so that the system can recover without switching to
          read-only mode.  This change, which is expected in 2.1 will
          also provide better write performance.

        - Errors during commit of sub-transactions were not handled
          correctly, leading to inconsistent object data.

        - Packing not not mark all transactions performed before the
          pack time as "packed". Undoing these transactions lead to a
          broken database.

        - On win9x systems, random data seems to be added to the end
          of the file on system crashes, causing apparent file
          corruption.  Code has been added to check for this case and
          recover by truncating the file with a log message.

        - The Zope version was not shown in the control panel.

        - The binary release had the PCGI wrapper program in the wrong
          directory so PCGI installations were not successful.


    Zope 2.0 beta 3
    
      Features added

        - Added a 'getobject' method to ZCatalog. This allows you to more
          easily get at a cataloged object from 'searchResults'. For
          example::
          
            <!--#in searchResults-->
            <!--#var "getobject(data_record_id_).title_or_id()"--><br>
            <!--#/in-->
      
      Bugs fixed

        - This release fixes a bug in acquisition that caused creation of
          ZClass instances to fail under some (common) circumstances.
        
        - Copy and Paste validation machinary now takes local roles into
          account.
          
        - ZDOM now adheres more closely to the DOM spec with respect to
          Document and DOMImplementation nodes.

        - The main management screen will no longer show the 'Delete' or
          'Export' buttons if the user doesn't have adequate permissions
          to delete or export objects respectively.

      
    Zope 2.0 beta 2

      Features added

        - Added a '-r' switch to z2.py for ZServer read-only mode.

        - The 'null' attribute in the DTML 'var' tag is now used when
          the value being output if the Python value 'None'. Some
          people considered this to be a bug.

        - Permission objects are automatically created for new ZClass
          objects as part of the ZClass wizard. 

        - For Python programmers, there is a new convenience function for
          debugging in the Zope package. 

          For example, to debug method spam in the Zope debugger::

            python
            import Zope
            Zope.debug('spam', d=1)

      Bugs fixed

        - Changed the logic used to detect binary content types to
          only look for control characters. The previous version
          incorrectly considered certain Latin-1 characters as
          binary.

        - The ZService.py used to implement Zope as a Win32 service 
          on NT has been updated to handle a difference in the way
          .dll files are found on internationalized versions of NT.

        - The configure.in file used to build PCGI has been updated.

        - Several fixes to DateTime were added to provide better
          behavior on machines with unrecognized time zone names.

        - Conflict errors, which occur when simultaneous writes occur
          to the same object in multiple database connections, are now
          handled correctly by re-executing (up to three times)
          the requests that lost the race condition.

        - Error formatting with standard_error_message has been moved
          to the object publisher via a new published module hook,
          'zpublisher_exception_hook'.  In addition to enabling
          conflict error handling, this fixed two other bugs:

           - Error handling in ExternalMethods and in DTML methods or
             documents called from other DTML documents or methods
             caused errors to be propagated in ways that defeated use of
             the try tag and other forms of error handling.

           - Errors raised before or after calling published objects
             were not formatted.

        - Errors in processing form variables, such as missing or
          miss-typed values resulted in server errors, rather than in
          formatted error reports.

        - Database browsing didn't work for ZGadflyDA database adapters.

        - Transaction meta data were not captured correctly by
          ZPublisher, which made the undo log look odd wrt the user
          who performed the transaction.

        - Permissions for version operations were not set correctly. This
          made it hard to delegate work to be done in versions and to
          separate version participation from version finalization.
          To fix this, it was necessary to split the "Join/Leave" view
          into separate "Join/Leave" and "Save/Discard" views.

        - No remark could be entered when discarding versions.
        
        - Fixed a ZServer kill_zombies bug which kept ZServer from killing
          hung connections.
          
        - Improved ZServer's handling of slightly broken HTTP requests.

        - Fixed a properties setting permission bug.
      
        - Fixed a product permissions registration bug that allowed
          product permission data to get lost.

        - Updated the MailHost product to use the new product initialization
          procedure. This fixed a MailHost adding permissions bug.
          
        - Made Z Class icons visible to everyone. This way you can view a
          Z Class icon without having and permissions on the Z Class.

        - Objects were sometimes incorrectly acquired do a bug in
          detecting attribute errors during acquisition. This led to
          errors getting covered up or obscured.

        - There was a memory leak in acquisition.

        - Some thread-safety problems were fixed.

        - DTML entity references (e.g. '&dtml-spam;') with missing
          semicolons  (e.g. '&dtml-spam') caused infinite loops.

        - Extra spaces around expressions in DTML caused syntax errors.

        - Broken objects, which are used as surrogates for objects
          that can no longer be instantiated due to missing product
          installations, no longer use HTML markup in their text
          representation, as this caused odd effects in HTML titles.

        - A number of fixes were made to the new DOM support.
  
        - Versions could be deleted by users working in the deleted
          versions. This led to strange paradoxical effects.  Attempts
          to delete a version or an object containing a version by
          someone working in a version now lead to errors.

        - ZGadflyDA has been updated to use the current (as of this
          release) version of Gadfly. (Note that this had been
          incorrectly reported as a 2.0 beta 1 feature.)

        - Using an sql method in a version sometimes caused the method
          to be locked, making it unusable by non-version users. This
          was due to the way that column meta-data was managed.  Now
          column meta-data, used by report creation wizards, is only
          safed when sql methods are tested.

        - In StructuredText, list items could not directly introduce
          example code.

        - Undoing transactions that discarded versions did not cause
          versions to appear non-empty.

        - Temporary files were created for file storages that were
          opened in read-only mode.

        - A bug in FileStorage and DemoStorage didn't show you more
          than the first 20 previous transactions in the Undo log.

        - An incorrect contents view was returned after adding a File
          object.

        - On the cache parameters page, the number of bytes, rather
          than the number of objects in the database was shown.

      Note:

        The section for Zope 2.0 alpha 4 did not mention that ZCatalog 
        is now shipped with the Zope core.


    Zope 2.0 beta 1

      Backward incompatibility

        - ZODB 2 is no longer supported or included!

        - The utility script bbb.py, no longer supports
          xml output.
    
      Known problems

        - Handling of conflict errors hasn't been implemented.  When
          two threads try to update the same object, one will get a
          conflict error. By beta release 2, requests that get conflict
          errors will be retried until they succeed (or fail without a
          conflict error) or until a maximum number of retries is
          exceeded.

      Features added
      
        - The default ports used by ZServer have been changed. The
          new default ports are: 8080 for HTTP, 8021 for FTP and
          8099 for the monitor server.

        - ZServer now uses the zLOG logging mechanism for informational and
          warning messages.
      
        - ZServer now includes a fairly stable NT service ZService.py

        - 'access' file now can use SHA-1 hashing, and now does by
          default

        - 'zpasswd.py' added to top directory to manage this
          new 'access' file

        - A number of changes have been made to enhance security
          control in through-the-web-developed products:

          - There are new "Permission" objects that can be added to 
            Products.  Permission objects provide a mechanism for
            defining new permissions. These new permissions show up in
            folder security screens.

          - Factory objects can have permission settings. This affects
            whether items show up in add lists and who can use factories.

          - Objects in products now have permission mapping rather
            than direct permission settings just like ZClass methods.

          - New permissions cannot be defined in ZClasses any longer.
            Rather, ZClasses can select from global permissions,
            including permissions defined with permission objects.

          Here's a sample scenario:

            1. Add a ZClass, "Container" with the option to create a
               factory and constructor methods.

            2. Add a permission object with the permission "Manage
               Containers".

            3. Change the permission of the factory created in step 1
               to "Manage Containers".

            4. Visit the ZClass created in step 1, view the "Define
               Permissions" view and map the "Create class instances"
               permission to "Manage Containers".

            5. Visit the constructor DTML Methods created in step 1,
               view the "Define Permissions" view and map the "View"
               permission to "Manage Containers".

          In this scenario, we created a ZClass and made it addable
          only by users (roles) that have the "Manage Containers" permission.

        - There is a new module, Shared.DC.THUNK
          (lib/python/Shared/DC/THUNK.py) that provides a mix-in class
          that implements ZODB 3 transaction protocols and that
          provides course-grained locking logic that should allow many
          non-thread-safe database adapters to be usable in
          multi-threaded Zope applications.  The Gadfly database
          adapter has been updated to use this mix-in class.

        - The transaction management mix-in classes (Shared.DC.TM.TM
          and Shared.DC.THUNK.THUNKED_TM) now provide a lower-level
          transaction management protocol.  Database adapters that mix
          these in should:

            - Call 'self._register()' when performing database
              queries, and

            - If necessary, override methods:

                _begin() -- Which is called to begin a transaction,

                _finish() -- Which is called to finish a transaction,
                             and save changes, or

                _abort() -- Which is called to abort (rollback) a transaction,
                            and discard changes, or

        - Object export now provides an XML export option and import
          files may be in Zope export format or XML format.

        - Zope objects that support the Zope management framework now
          support the DOM 1.0 read interfaces.  This allows DOM read
          methods and attributes to be usable with Zope objects and
          Python DOM tools, like FourThought's 4XSL to work with Zope
          objects.  

          Note that DOM-defined attributes are defined with "get"
          methods. For example, to get the DOM-defined "parentNode"
          attribute, use: 'object.getParentNode()'.

        - The pyexpat extension module for using James Clark's 
          expat library for parsing XML is included in the
          distribution as Shared.DC.pyexpat.

      Bugs Fixed
      
        - You can no longer cd to an acquired directory in ZServer FTP.

        - A number of changes were made for thread safety.  This was not as
          hard as it sounds, since persistent objects are always
          thread-safe. (Well, only one thread accesses any particular
          copy of a persistent object.)  The biggest issue here is
          mutable global variables, mutable objects stored in classes, 
          mutable default Python function arguments, and global
          variables in extensions.


    Zope 2.0 alpha 4

      Backward incompatibility

        - The old ZopeHTTPServer is no longer supported or included.
          Use ZServer.

      Features added

        - The let and return tags were added to DTML.

        - Several new input form types were added:

            :default -- allows you to specify default values

            :record -- allows you to combine multiple form variables
                       into a single input variable.
 
                For example::

                   <input name="date.year:record:int">
                   <input name="date.month:record:int">
                   <input name="date.day:record:int">

                will result in a single variable, 'date', with
                attributes 'year', 'month', and 'day'.

            :records -- allows you to input a list of records (ie a
                        table)

            :ignore-empty -- If the field if the value is an empty
                             string.

          For more information, see the section on "Form variable
          types" in http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Reference/Trinkets.

        - In the startup script, z2.py:

        - The startup script, z2.py, has additional documentation on
          providing empty strings as arguments.
    
        - Added a -P option to the startup script, z2.py, to specify a
          base port for the various servers. For example::
        
            python z2.py -P8000 
        
              is equivalent to:
        
            python z2.py -w8080 -f8021 -m8099
        
              This is a convenient short-hand for systems with many zserver
              instances running.
    
        - Added an -l option to the startup script, z2.py, to specify
          the location of the ZServer hit log. If the location is a
          relative path, then it is assumed to be rooted in the 'var'
          directory.

        - A progress indicator was added to the database conversion
          utility, utilities/bbb.py.

        - The PCGI installer now writes the PCGI info file to use ZODB 3
          rather than ZODB 2.
    
        - The default content is provided in both ZODB 2 and ZODB 3
          format.

        - There is a new logging framework for reporting errors from
          Python-level code.  See the module zLOG.py for details.

          For the time being, to turn on logging, set the environment
          variable STUPID_LOG_FILE to a file name or to an empty
          string to log to standard error.  We will eventually provide
          a more formal and functional logging configuration
          interface.

        - The hooks used by objects that modify their environment were
          changed.  The new hooks are:

            manage_addHook -- called after an object has been added

            manage_beforeDelete -- called before an object is deleted

            manage_afterClone -- called after an object has been
               copied. This should only be used by object that 
               capture their identity is some way other than their 
               id attribute or persistent id. (It's really for
               ZClasses, which have global ids.)
 
        - Pack is now supported for ZODB3 File Storages.
    
        - The header output by manage_tabs now shows whether the
          current object has been modified or locked by a version and
          shows the version if the version isn't the current working
          version. 
    
            - The locked-in-version decoration in the object management
              contents view shows the locking version if the version isn't
              the current working version.
    
            - Several demonstration ZODB Storage implementations have been
              added. See lib/python/ZODB/DemoStorage.py and
              lib/python/ZODB/dbmStorage.py.
    
        - Subtransactions have been added (instead of temporary
          versions). If a true argument is given in a transaction commit
          or abort call (e.g. 'get_transaction().commit(1)'), then
          the commit or abort applies to a subtransaction of the
          current transaction.  This is useful in a number of ways,
          including:
    
                o Subtransaction commits on requests that work with lots
                  of data can reduce memory usage because data can be
                  removed from memory after changes are saved in a
                  subtransaction, 
    
                o You can rollback changes due to a local error without
                  rolling back *all* of the changes made in a long
                  transaction. 

        - There is an advanced interface for specifying alternate
          storages for Zope.  Zope will try to import the module
          'custom_zodb' from INSTANCE_HOME and use it's Storage
          attribute. 

          For example, to use a Demo storage based on the standard
          File storage, you might define a 'custom_zodb' module with::

            import Globals, ZODB.FileStorage, ZODB.DemoStorage

            name='%s/Data.fs' % Globals.data_dir

            base=ZODB.FileStorage.FileStorage(name, read_only=1)
            Storage=ZODB.DemoStorage.DemoStorage("Demo (%s)" % name, base)

        - Find can now search text of SQL methods.

        - DTML tree tags now have a reverse option.

        - ZClasses now have class ids.  These class ids are registered
          in a central registry and are used when unpicking instances.

        - Database connections now have a sync method for
          synchronizing the connection with saved data.  This is
          useful for interactive connections to see database changes
          made by other threads.

        - Errors encountered when trying to unpickle object state are
          now logged, if logging is enabled.

        - Added an extra checkpoint to ZODB 3 FileStorage Transaction
          commit to better handle system crashes.

        - ZPublisher request objects now have a BODYFILE key to get
          the request body as a file for non-form non-GET requests.

        - Cookie support was added to the ZServer FTP server to make
          FTP access compatible with cookie-based authentication.

        - ZServer now includes a NT Service, 'ZServer.py' This service
          requires the Python win32 extensions. It is not yet complete
          and not yet integrated with the Zope installer. It does however
          include a large doc string.
    
        - ZServer is officially using the z2.py start script now. The old
          start.py and zinit.py were removed. Note: z2.py will call zdaemon.py
          for you, if you want to use ZServer in daemon mode on Unix.
    
        - Added a 'has_permission' method to user objects. This facilitates
          finding out if a user has access to a given object. For example::
          
            <!--#if "AUTHENTICATED_USER.has_permissions('View',someObject)"-->
    
        - The product add list is now filtered. This should keep
          objects out of the product add list for which the user does
          not have adequate permissions. This is implemented with a
          new method, 'filtered_meta_types' which returns all the
          meta_types for which a given user has permissions. Note:
          Right now ZClasses do not associate permissions with
          Products. Thus all Control Panel Products appear in the
          product add list, no matter what roles the user has.
            
        - HTTP REQUEST objects now use HTML in their string representation.

        - The REQUEST keys of the form BASEx and URLx, where x is
          an integer now allow x to be greater than 9.
    
        - index_html is not longer used automatically for XML-RPC
          requests.

        - ZPublisher debugger, 'ZPublisher.test' now accepts a 'extra'
          keyword argument with a dictionary giving extra variables to
          be added to the request. This is handy for testing methods
          that require large amounts of input data, such as file uploads.

        - The load_site utility ('utilities/load_site.py') now accepts
          a '-9' switch to make it work with Zope (and Principia)
          sites at revisions 1.9 and lower. 

      Bugs fixed

        - Got rid of some DOS line-endings in xmlrpclib.py that caused
          install-time module compilation to fail.

        - Fixed DOS line-endings in medusa/max_sockets.py

        - Fixed a NameError (missing TupleType) definition in
          the export/import (copy/paste) machinery.

        - The startup script failed on Windows because it imported the
          posix module without checking the os.

        - ZServer crashed when the number of simultaneous connections
          exceeded a system limit, especially on Windows. ZServer now
          stops accepting new connections when the number of active
          connections exceeds a threshold.

        - Accessing cached results of items() (or values() or keys())
          calls on BTrees caused core dumps if affected elements were
          deleted.  For example::
    
                 for k in abtree.keys(): 
                    del abtree[k]

          Note that this code is still incorrect due to the fact that
          the objects returned from abtree.items()  (or values() or
          keys()) have reference, rather than copy semantics.
 
        - Compiling Acquisition.c caused (bogus) compiler errors on
          SGI.

        - zdeemun wus mispeled

        - Local roles were not handled correctly when filtering
          management views.

        - Copying and pasting ZClass instances copied and pasted their
          ZClasses too, effectively disconnecting them from their
          managed ZClasses. The same thing happened when ZClass
          instances were exported and imported.

        - The Database area in the control panel was broken.

        - Copy and paste of multiple objects was broken.

        - Copy and paste of ZClass methods was broken.

        - Copy and paste of ZClass properysheets was enabled and
          broken. It is now disabled.

        - Accidental import of BoboPOS in processes using ZODB (3)
          caused strange errors.

        - A bug in batch processing caused batch processing to hang or
          give incorrect results.

        - DocumentTemplate-based classes, like DTMLDocument and
          DTMLMethod could not be subclassed correctly. 

        - There was a memeory leak in the DTML try tag.

        - When adding folders with user databases, no check was made
          to make sure the user was permitted to add a user database.

        - Broken objects weren't created for objects whose class could
          not be found when using ZODB 3.

        - The 'self' argument wasn't properly passed to external
          methods used in ZClasses.

        - The Setup file in the SearchIndex package had an unneeded -I
          option that caused compilation errors on some platforms.

        - ZGadflyDA transactions were not committed.

        - ZClasses didn't provide an interface to edit their titles.

        - Propertysheets were broken for ZClasses that inherited from
          built-in classes, like Folder and DTMLDocument.

        - Propertysheets were disabled for instances by default.  Now,
          propertysheets have the "manage properties" permission by
          default.

        - The navigation pane wasn't updated when classes were added.

        - Changes in ZClasses were not properly propagated to all
          database connections using ZODB3.

        - Database connections were not closed correctly under heavy
          load when the number of application threads exceeded the
          number of database connections in the connection pool. This
          lead to Zope locking up under load if the application thread
          count was increased using the z2.py -t option.

        - undo in ZODB 3 didn't properly refresh objects.
 
        - export and import was broken for ZODB 3.
          
        - Fixed ZServer HTTP zombie killing. Now hung connections are
          successfully closed.

        - A bug in handling the case when a file was created on open
          without the create flag caused weird errors on windows.

        - The REQUEST BASE1 key was not computed correctly when
          SCRIPT_NAME was an empty string.

        - It was impossible to return an empty list or dictionary to
          an XML-RPC request. 
 
        - The database conversion script fails when the first record
          in the input file lacked properly-formatted transaction
          data.  The conversion script also didn't work on some
          systems due to an incorrect 'flush' call on the *input*
          file. 

        - Factories that were also ZClass methods didn't get
          unregistered properly when they were deleted.


    Zope 2.0 alpha 3

      Features added

        - XML-RPC support

          All Zope objects are now XML-RPC servers.

        - ZODB 2 (aka BoboPOS) to ZODB 3 FileStorage database conversion

          An option has been added to the bbb.py script in the
          utilities directory to convert ZODB 2 database files to ZODB
          3 format. The bbb.py script now accepts an '-f' option that
          takes an argument specifying an output file name.  For
          example, to convert the ZODB 2 data file, Data.bbb, in the
          var directory, to ZODB 3 FileStorage format::

            python utilities/bbb.py -f var/Data.fs var/Data.bbb

          Note that version data are not converted.

        - In Z Classes, Methods and Property Sheets now have a "Define
          Permissions" management tab to map permissions. This tab used
          to be labeled "Security".

        - ZServer's FTP server now attempts to display an object's owner
          as defined in local roles.  

      Bugs fixed

        - The cache management screens were broken

        - Local roles on DTML Methods and Documents were not persistent.

        - ZServer's select trigger has been updated and now shouldn't give
          errors when running ZServer as another users.   

        - The tree tag used persistent object ids in ways that were 
          not compatible with ZODB 3.  This caused strange behavior
          like weird content-types and invalid state messages.

        - The DTML In tag no longer handled batch processing correctly, 
          and sometimes got into infinite loops.  This was due to a very
          old bug that was made effective by Python 1.5.2.

        - Objects that could not be loaded because their implementing modules
          (or packages) had been removed were not handled properly as
          broken objects when ZODB 3 was used.

        - The DTML Python string format did not allow expressions for 
          simple variable insertion.  Expression insertion is now
          allowed if the var tag name if the var tag name is supplied,
          as in::

            %(var expr="x+1")s

          Note that, because of this change, the var tag name must
          also be supplied when a variable named 'var' is inserted, as
          in::

            %(var var)s


    Zope 2.0 alpha 2

      Features added

        - There is a new optional EXPERIMENTAL HTML DTML syntax.  As
          an alternative to SSI syntax, you can now use ordinary HTML
          syntax, as in:

            <dtml-in objectIds>
              <dtml-var sequence-item>
            </dtml-in>

          You can also use an entity-reference syntax for the var tag
          as an alternative to the tag syntax.  For example::

            &dtml-foo;

          is equivalent to::

            <dtml-var foo>

          and is especially handy in attributes::

            <a href="&dtml-foo;">

          Both the new syntax and the SSI syntax are allowed in the
          same document.  In fact, if you were really twisted, you
          could:

            <dtml-in objectIds>
              <dtml-var sequence-item>
            <!--#/in-->

          IMPORTANT

             This feature really is EXPERIMENTAL.  It could disappear
            someday, depending on how people like it.  We'd really like
            to get feedback on how useful this feature is.

        - reverse options were added to the in and tree tags.

        - The startup script, z2.py, has a -D option to turn on
          debugging mode.

        - Made environment variable settings work with the http
          server. So now you can do things like ./z2.py -w 8888
          SCRIPT_NAME=Zope and actually have the specified SCRIPT_NAME
          override the normal SCRIPT_NAME. This is Useful for using ZServer
          behind a proxy.

        - Added support for the Medusa monitor server.

        - There's a first cut at a ZServer NT service. This is Zope on
          NT's answer to zdeamon.py

          It actually seems to work, though there's still a fair
          amount missing.

        - The error messages for missing or miss-formatted access
          files was improved.

        - A new debugging method, manage_debug, has been added to
          Control_Panel to monitor the Zope process for possible
          memory leaks.

        - The name, 'this', has been added to the namespace available
          to construction methods to provide a function for computing
          the destination object.  The name, 'this' is essentially
          equivalent to 'Destination' and 'Destination' will be
          deprecated eventually.

        - The title of the main Zope management interface now includes
          a full URL.

        - Folders that have (or acquire) index_html methods now have
          view tabs for viewing index_html.

        - On browsers that support Java Script, the "Add" button is
          omitted and the add form is visited as soon as a selection
          is made from the select list.

        - The python-pickle format used to export data from ZODB 2 was
          updated to handle string data differently.

        - Update syslog clients to try for SOCK_DGRAM first, since newer
          syslogd won't accept SOCK_STREAM connections (Collector #888).

      Bugs fixed

        - A number of bugs and features were left out of the 
          release notes for Zope 2.0 alpha 1.  The notes for
          Zope 2.0 alpha 1 have been updated substantially.

        - There was a serious memory leak introduced when a security
          bug was fixed in 1.10.0.

        - There was a memory leak in ZODB 3 persistent objects, which
          now manage object IDs as persistent objects.

        - The Python 1.5.2 cgi module didn't work with Zope.  
          Zope now includes its own fixed version of the module.

          This bug caused FTP, Netscape Publishing and WebDAV to fail.

        - A bug in transaction management caused Gadfly requests to
          fail. Other database adapters need to be updated.

        - Running ZServer as nobody failed due to the order in which
          the log file was opened.
          
        - Added fix contributed by Brian Hooper for HTTP Clients which
          don't always spell their HTTP headers correctly.

        - A number of classes didn't get there reference-counts
          reduced when instances were destroyed.  This confused the
          new memory allocation monitoring tool.

        - New user folders had no effect because they did not get
          properly registered in their containing folders.

        - Changes made to factory objects were lost when a process was
          restarted. 
          
        - Clicking on the 'Help' caused the help information to be
          displayed in the current frame, rather than in a new
          window. 

        - Shutting down Zope attempted to save the database index even
          when Zope was run in read-only mode.

        - A number of fixes were made in the Date-Time support.

        - Batch processing in the in tag sometimes failed.

        - Sites with custom roles in the top-level application
          object did not pick up the new 'Owner' role.
          
        - Content-type detection had problems in DTML documents and
          methods. 

        - Some cookie expiration dates used 2-digit years.

        - Error values for errors raised by ExternalMethods were lost.

        - Values returned by absolute_url were not URL quoted.

        - Extra newlines were prepended to documents when they were
          edited.

        - Objects ids were not properly quoted in a number of places,
          because id quoting was unnecessary until recent relaxation
          of the rules for ids.
          
        - ExternalMethods are now automatically reloaded when running
          in debug mode.

        - Search interfaces generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer include a "Cancel" button.

        - Errors were masked by a bug in handling ZODB3 transaction
          aborts. 

        - The ZODB 3 cache manager deactivated objects too quickly,
          causing performance to degrade.

        - BASEx request variables were not computed correctly when
          SCRIPT_NAME was not empty.

        - The URLx variables couldn't be computed in some cases when
          using ZServer.


    Zope 2.0 alpha 1

      BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY

        - A change was made to the way ZClasses are constructed.

          Previously, the __call__ method was an alias for the
          index_html method which took took an id and a request
          and created a new instance and added the instance to
          the destination.
          
          Now, the __call__ method simply calls the underlying
          managed class with the supplied arguments to create and
          return an instance.  The instance is not added to a
          folder.
          
          The index_html method is now an alias for the
          createInObjectManager method, which does what the
          index_html method did before.
          
          There is a new method, fromRequest, that takes an id
          and a request and creates a new instance.  It does not
          at the instance to a destination.

      Features Added

        - Integration of ZODB 3

        - The ZClass construction interface has been cleaned up to
          make construction of ZClasses a little easier from Python.

        - When adding ZClasses, there is now an option to
          automatically create construction methods and a factory.

        - "Management" screens now *only* show tabs a user permitted
          to see.  Used in combination with carefully selected roles, 
          this change provides an adaptable management interface.

        - Instance homes can now have local Products directories.

        - There is a new ZServer start up script that can be used without
          modification and that integrates process management.  This
          script replaces the ZServer 'start.py' and 'zinit.py' scripts.

        - When the new startup script is used, then the control panel
          shows a "Restart" button which causes the Zope process to
          exit and be restarted and a "Shutdown" button that causes Zope 
          to exit and not be restarted.

        - There is a *very* rough cut at a centralized version manager
          in the control panel.  This is only functional when the
          ZODB3 database is used.  This feature will mature
          significantly before the final 2.0 release.
   
        - A new Zope icon was added, and the "powered by Zope" icon
          has been updated.

        - Made DTMLDocuments, DTMLMethods, Images, Files and Folders
          subclassable by ZClasses.

        - ZClass property sheets can now have read and modify
          permissions.

        - An "add list" name can be specified when creating a ZClass.
          If specified, then construction methods and a factory are
          created. This makes the class immediately instantiatable and
          provides construction method examples.

        - The ZClass basic property sheet now shows base classes.

        - Changed the string representation of HTTPRequest so that
          <!--#var REQUEST--> is a lot friendlier.
 
        - Added a Zope debugging short cut.  

          Now::

            import ZPublisher
            ZPublisher.Zope(path)

          is a shortcut for::

            import ZPublisher
            ZPublisher.test('Zope', path)

      Bugs Fixed

        - ZClass permission setting interfaces didn't show inherited
          permissions.

        - A number of bugs arising from attempts to set 
          caching headers were fixed.

        - Some default permissions were not set correctly.

        - The unused non-functioning resource-consuming Scheduler has
          been removed.

        - Access was given to objects without roles even if access
          would be denied to the container.

        - Fix submitted by Martijn Pieters:

          Any property type int or long, set to 0, showed up in the
          Properties Management tab as blank. This resulted in errors
          when trying to change values of other properties, etc.

        - Version names were computed incorrectly.

        - Delete and rename were broken for ZClasses.

        - It wasn't possible to override inherited attributes with
          methods in ZClasses.

        - Property values were not removed from ZClasses when property
          sheets were deleted.  This made it impossible to re-add a
          property from a deleted property sheet.

        - Generated property view and edit forms for ZClass property
          sheets had a number of problems.

        - The propertysheets property sheet should only allow addition of
          property sheets.


    Zope 1.11.0 pr1, which should have been named Zope 2.0.0 alpha 0.
      
      Lots has changed in this release. The major news is ZClasses and WebDAV.
      
      Features Added

        - Added WebDAV support. See http://webdav.zope.org/ for details.

        - Added Z Classes. Documentation is forthcoming.

          ZClasses might be viewed as somewhat experimental, although
          we're using them aggressively for internal projects.

        - Added Property Sheets. Documentation is forthcoming.
        
        - ZServer now included in distribution.
        
        - Added new product registration interface. Documentation is
          forthcoming.

        - Added local roles which allow for permission settings for
          users on individual objects. This allows for 'ownership' of Zope
          objects. Added 'Owner' role to default roles, and automatic
          setting of the 'Owner' role on a created object to the user who
          created it.
        
        - Added hooks for XML-RPC support to ZPublisher. See the source
          for details. XML-RPC support is not yet finished.
        
        - Added automatic height/width detection for JPEG images.

        - Revised Zope error messages.

        - A new DTML 'try' tag added based on work by Jordan B. Baker.
          See the source for details. Documentation is forthcoming.

        - A new DTML 'mime' tag has been added. See the MIMETools README.txt
          for more information.

        - A new 'range' function added the the '_' DTML variable. 

        - A new 'utilities' directory is included in the distribution.

        - A new flag attribute, 'only', of the DTML 'with' tag
          prunes the DTML namespace to only the namespace created
          with the with tag.

        - Added contributed support for encoding options in the SendMail
          tag and MailHost send method.
          
        - Management tabs are now prettier and allow status messages with
          the manage_tabs_message variable.
          
        - Added a method of notifying users of changes without using a
          MessageDialog. This makes editing DTML Documents and Methods
          easier.
          
        - Added more documentation to Product add screens.

        - New icons for many Zope objects.

        - Sessions are now known as Versions.

        - Changed from using 'manage_main' as default management method to use
          'manage_workspace' which is a reserved method that dispatches to the
          default management interface which is the first interface defined
          in manage_options

        - Permission settings are now inherited by Products from their base
          classes. This means when you build a Product you only need to specify
          its particular permission settings.

        - Changed ZPublisher.publish_module's interface so that instead of
          providing a stdin, stdout, and stderr, you can provide a Request and
          a Response object. ZServer makes extensive use of this feature.

        - Added methods to HTTPRequest to allow access to ZPublishers object
          traversal. HTTPRequest.clone and HTTPRequest.resolve_url. See the
          source for more details.
          
        - Added a new "builtin" function reorder to DTML.
        
          reorder(s, [with, without]])
 
          Reorder the items in s according to the order given in with
          and with items mentioned in without removed.  Items from s
          not mentioned in with are removed.

          s, with, and without are all either sequences if strings
          or sequences of key-value tuples, with ordering done on the
          keys.

          This function is useful for constructing ordered select lists.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added small fixes to ZopeHTTPServer in anticipation of DAV.

        - Construction, upload, and edit methods did not consistently
          support either string or file data.  This caused really weird
          behavior when file upload was used with out including the 
          ':string' suffix in the argument name when doing a file upload.

          This bug was previously (and incorrectly) reported as a 
          ZPublisher.Client problem.

        - Errors in ExternalMethods were masked by bugs in error
          reporting logic.  The bugs were made far more effective
          by Python 1.5.1.

        - Databases (or export files) created in binary distributions
          were not usable in source distributions due to cPickle
          limitations in stock Python 1.5.1.  We now link/copy the
          cPickle extension to BoboPOS to make sure that it uses the
          latest version.

        - Fixed registration of MailHost settings and incorrect default
          quoted-printable encoding of message bodies.

        - Added contributed patch that fixes bug in copied-object id
          generation.

        - DTML Documents and Methods now attempt to determine their
          content-type rather than assuming they are text/html.

        - Fixed PUT bug in determining content-type of binary files.

        - Added changes that allow the top level userfolder to be replaced by a
          UserDB or other userfolder-like object.

        - Fixed an FTP support bug that sometimes kept simple items from
          producing FTP listings.

        - Added URL1 instead of "." as the form target for the workspace forms --
          using "." causes NS servers to intercept the request and report an
          error, making Zope effectively unusable.

        - Added ZPL 1.0 and credits to copyright link in management screen.
          
        - Fixed a bug that prevented validate() from working if the top-level
          object were accessed and no default object (index_html) existed.

        - Fixed a logic bug in security validation that allowed access to
          unacquired objects that didn't have __roles__ even if the
          containing object was protected.


    Zope  1.10.2

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a permission problem with DTMLMethod objects that caused
          errors when attempting to commit permission changes.

        - Factories could not determine the available methods
          when they were being edited, making them uneditable.


    Zope  1.10.1

      This is a Python 1.5.2 beta 2 compatibility release.

      A Python C API change in Python 1.5.2 beta 2 broke
      Zope.  This release contains a fix.

      Zope should work correctly with Python 1.5, 1.5.1 and
      beta versions of 1.5.2.


    Zope  1.10.0

      New Features

        - Added Import/Export interfaces to Folders.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a bug in ZopeHTTPServer which caused it to fail on POST
          requests without content-type headers.

        - PUT and file uploads would fail if the content-type could
          not be determined. Now objects created via PUT and file
          upload will default to either 'application/octet-stream'
          for binary files or 'text/plain' for non-binary files if
          no content-type can be determined from headers or filename
          extensions.

        - Fixed a permission bug left from a change to the Find support.

        - Fixed misc typos in docstrings and docs.

        - Fixed a bug that kept objects from being freed from the cache!
          Basically, there was never a check for inactive objects.

        - MailHost objects didn't do appropriate CRLF conversion or
          recognize 4xx server responses.


    Zope  1.10.0 pr1

      New Features

        - Documents generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer use tab characters.

        - Added a -s option to ZopeHTTPServer.  This is useful
          for emulating older sites when generating screen shots
          for creating or updating documentation.

        - Default bobobase now includes a Zope button along with a link
          to the Zope site. This satisfies the ZPL attribution requirement.
          The button is created by a new builtin method
          'ZopeAttributionButton'. Also, both the source and the binary
          distributions now have the same default bobobase.

        - Made the logic for getting SOFTWARE_HOME a bit more robust, so that 
          it handles relative paths and paths starting with '.' and '..'.
          This is useful when simply importing Main from the Python
          prompt in the lib/python directory.

        - The ThreadLock module has been changed to reflect changes
          in the Python API in Python 1.5.2.

        - The '_' variable in DTML now has the random module
          as an attribute and DateTime.DateTime as the attribute DateTime.

        - Added keys() and items() methods to the REQUEST object.

        - Added get_header() method to the REQUEST object for retrieving
          HTTP headers.

        - New SearchIndex package and BTree component have been added to 
          the distribution, providing low-level support for products with
          built-in searching such as Tabula and Confera.

        - Documents have now been split into two distinct object types:
          DTML Documents and DTML Methods. DTML Methods behave exactly
          as Document objects did. DTML Documents are similar except that
          the "client" or "self" of a DTML Document is the DTML Document
          itself rather than its parent, and DTML Documents can have
          properties.

        - DTML Documents, Image and File objects can now have properties.

        - A new PropertyManager mixin class allows developers to easily
          add properties and property management to non-Folder objects.

        - Added a new absolute_url method which can generate an absolute
          url for the object on which the method is called.

        - GIF and PNG Images now figure out their own dimensions when
          uploaded. Image height and width properties are now editable.

        - Images now generate themselves as html IMG tags, using an absolute
          url and correct height and width tags if possible.

        - There is a new form input type, boolean, for inputing boolean
          data.

        - Added a read_only option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors to open a database in read_only
          mode.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_READ_ONLY, used by the
          Zope framework.  If this variable is set, then the database
          is opened in read only mode.  If this variable is set to a
          string parsable by DateTime.DateTime, then the database is
          opened read-only as of the time given.  Note that changes
          made by another process after the database has been opened
          are not visible.

        - Added a database_quota option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors and a
          SimpleDB.MultipleRevision.set_quota method to set a database
          quota. The quota is given as either an integer number of
          bytes, or a function taking an integer number of bytes
          argument and returning whether the quota has been exceeded.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_DATABASE_QUOTA, used by the
          Zope framework. If this variable is set, it should be set to
          an integer number of bytes.  Additions to the database are
          not allowed if the database size exceeds the quota.          

        - Added size and last modification time to DTML Method and DTML
          Document edit interface.

        - Added a new module, BoboPOS.winlock, that provides file
          locking on windows.  This should prevent many cases of data
          corruption. 

        - Added FTP support to Documents, Files, Images, and Folders.
          FTP interface is detailed in OFS/FTPInterface.py though it may
          change. Basic FTP support was also added to SimpleItem to make
          it easier for Zope objects to support FTP.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Permissions for manage_clone method were wrong, meaning that
          essentially only managers could use it.

        - File paths that showed up in tracebacks reflected the paths the 
          files had when they were compiled (at distribution build-time).
          The compiled-in paths have been changed to be relative to the
          Zope installation directory.

        - Fixed a bug in ZPublisher's special handling the "cancel"
          submit buttons. The test for the cancel button was case
          sensitive.  I changed it so it would accept any case, as
          well as extra spaces.

          Cancel buttons should probably be handled using the new
          :method form type, but this would require the presense of an
          appropriate redirect method.  Perhaps there should be
          a :redirect form type.

        - Date strings with years < 31 were not accepted, even
          through the documentation says they should be.

        - If Zope crashed or was unable to completely write a database
          record, then on restart, a data corruption error was reported.
          Now, truncated records are removed if necessary on start up.
          If necessary, other records are removed as well to avoid 
          partially-written transactions.

        - Lack of sys.argv in the win32 service version of Zope caused 
          it to raise errors under certain conditions.

        - Several HTTP PUT related bugs were fixed.

        - Simple items did not have an objectValues method, which caused
          odd behavior in certain tree tags since the method would be
          acquired from the parent of the simple item.

        - The Find form in the management interface depended on javascript
          to function properly.

        - Added a fix to compensate for the fact that Apache servers may 
          rename the entire cgi environment when mod_rewrite rules are 
          used in .htaccess files.

        - If system clocks were changed, so that database records 
          had records in the "future", then database corruption could
          either occur or be incorrectly reported.  Now this situation
          results in an informative error message and corruption does
          not occur.


    Zope 1.9.0

      New Features

        - Zope now provides better information about products.  If a 
          Product has a README.txt, then it will be readable through
          the product management interface.   

          If a product encounters an error during startup, the
          traceback is available through the product management
          interface.

        - Cache statistics are displayed in minutes, rather than
          seconds.

        - Products can define the attribute '__module_aliases__' in
          their '__init__' modules that specifies aliases for modules
          used in the product.  This is useful if module names have
          changed and the database contains pickles refering to the
          old modules.  The attribute should be a sequence of
          tuples. Each tuple has a (dotted) module name and a module.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Development on ZopeHTTPServer has been frozen in anticipation
          of the switch to Medusa. Therefor ZopeHTTPServer still does
          support PUT. Sorry.

        - ZPublisher.Client used the obsolete rand module.

        - Errors occuring during product import caused Zope to fail to come
          up.

        - Product version information was not displayed correctly.

        - ZGadflyDA cached table meta-data which lead to missleading
          information when browsing databases.


    Zope 1.9 beta 3

      New Features

        - Z SQL Methods (FKA Aqueduct) and the Z Gadfly Database Adapter
          are now included.

        - The argument handling for ZopeHTTPServer has been changed to 
          be a bit more flexible wrt the order of argumements.  
          While options must still come first, environment settings
          can be given in any order.  This makes startup scripts loke
          serve.py quite a bit simpler.

        - ZopeHTTPServer now sports preliminary support for PUT publishing.
          
        - ZopeHTTPServer now serves from port 9673 by default, not 8080.

      Bugs fixed

        - The start.bat file used to start ZopeHTTPServer on win32 was
          misnamed and didn't correctly pass command-line arguments.

        - Win32 machines without an existing Python installation had problems
          due to PYTHONPATH bootstrapping.

        - The included ZopeHTTPServer was failing to start correctly on
          win32 machines that were not connected to the network.


    Zope 1.9 beta 2

      In addition to various documentation updates, this release includes:

      New Features

        - Changed serve.py to accept ZopeHTTPServer command-line options.

        - Added a -P option to the ZopeHTTPServer to specify a file
          to contain the process ID.  This allows a script to stop
          the process on Unix.

        - Added support for the environment variables, Z_REALM and
          Z_DEBUG_MODE to set an authentication realm and to
          enable debug mode.

      Bugs fixed

        - External methods were broken due to differences in 
          Python 1.4 and Python 1.5 comparison semantics.

        - ZopeHTTPServer command-line environment settings
          were not available in os.environ.

        - Some class references were wrong in examples in the ExtensionClass
          documentation.

        - INSTANCE_HOME was not set correctly when the debugger was run
          with a relative path to the published module.

        - The #! line in the ZopeHTTPServer was hidden by the copyright
          statement and didn't have the right path.

        - A bug in pcgi_publisher.py caused file uploads larger than 1 MB
          to fail.


    Zope 1.9 beta 1

      Bugs fixed:

        - pcgi did not build correctly on Solaris 2.6

        - links in headers were broken when Zope was reached with
          /, as is the case when the ZopeHTTPServer is used.

        - Python sources used tabs and spaces for indentation, which
          made some people unhappy.

        - Copyright statements were missing or out of date.
        
        - Added better instructions for building and running Zope.

        - Added new Zope License and attribution information.

        - Merged BoboHTTPServer updates with ZopeHTTPServer. Including 
          socket changes to allow easier stopping and starting.

        - Shutting down the ZopeHTTPServer from the application
          caused an empty document to be returned.

        - The install scripts failed if run more than once when attempting
          to create a var directory.

      Features

        - Added (and old version of) the zlib module to make
          installation simpler.

        - Zope requires an access file.  The install scripts now create
          one.


    Zope 1.9 alpha 1 

      This was the inital Zope test release.
