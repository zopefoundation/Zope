Using Zope with an existing web server
--------------------------------------

  While Zope comes with a web server, you may wish to use it with an
  existing web server.  Use Persistent CGI (PCGI) or FastCGI to allow
  your existing web server to work with Zope on Unix and Windows.

  Roughly, PCGI is a protocol for translating CGI requests from a web
  server into Zope requests.  CGI requests are traditionally one shot
  events; the web server handles a request for a CGI script by
  spawning a new process to handle the requests, returning the results
  of the request when the process dies.

  Zope is a long running process, which means that it does not start
  up and die on each request like traditional CGI programs.  If it
  did, each request would take far too long due to the time to start
  and stop an application server like Zope.  Thus, PCGI is one of the
  options for gatewaying from the separate CGI processes to the Zope
  long running process.

  FastCGI is very similar to PCGI.  Where PCGI has a "wafer-thin"
  external CGI program to connect Apache and Zope, FastCGI has an
  Apache module.  This saves the so called "fork tax" which is incurred
  when Apache forks to execute the PCGI CGI program.


Using Zope in multi-threaded mode with ZServer
----------------------------------------------

  ZServer is a general purpose TCP server for publishing Zope objects
  over various transport protocols.  For Zope to run multi-threaded,
  you must run ZServer.

  ZServer is based on Sam Rushing's Medusa software.  The benefit of
  using Medusa as the ZServer core is that it is not protocol specific
  (Medusa provides libraries to program for any protocol) and it is
  easily extensible.  Because Medusa is written in Python, is
  extremely high performance by design, and comes with an HTTP and FTP
  server, we chose it for the Zope core.

  It is not necessary, however, for ZServer to actually listen for
  incoming HTTP requests.  If you want Apache to do the actual
  listening and serving, then you can use ZServer's PCGI or FastCGI
  components to communicate with Apache.

 PCGI

  To run ZServer with PCGI, you must specify the -p option to the
  'z2.py' startup script.  From the top level Zope directory, you
  can::

    bash% python1.5.2 z2.py -p

  Note, you must have gone through the directions in 'INSTALL.txt' for
  this to work.

  This command will start ZServer up with PCGI (by default, it will
  also start up an HTTP and FTP server).  For PCGI to work, the
  webserver and Zope must agree on a PCGI resource file.  If this file
  is not named 'Zope.cgi' and is not in the same directory as 'z2.py',
  then you can specify the file name after the '-p', like::

    bash% python.1.5.2 z2.py -p /path/to/PCGI/resource/file

  Now the Zope long running process is started up, and the PCGI
  component is loaded and ready to receive CGI requests from your
  webserver.  

  The installation process should create a 'Zope.cgi' PCGI file. Copy
  the 'Zope.cgi' file to your web server's 'cgi-bin' directory.
  
  On Unix you can also create a symbolic link to 'Zope.cgi' from your
  cgi-bin directory. For example::

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  At this point you should perform any other steps you web server
  requires to install and configure a CGI script.

  Note: For more information on PCGI check out Jeff Bauer's "PCGI pages", 
  http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/.

  When your Zope.cgi file is correctly configured as a CGI script with
  your web server, you are ready to access Zope through the web. You
  should point your browser at:

    'http://youmachine.example.com:8998/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/manage'

  (Your URL maybe be different depending on how your web server is configured.)

  You should be prompted to enter a username and password.  Enter the
  Zope "super manager" name and password.

  Note: Apache requires some tricky configuration to get it to pass
  the HTTP authentication header information to Zope.  See the section 
  'Zope authentication with existing web servers'.

 FastCGI

  FastCGI is relatively easy to set up if you have installed an Apache
  module before.  If you haven't, don't worry, it isn't difficult.  It
  comes with straightforward instructions.  You will need to download
  the mod_fastcgi module from FastCGI.com:

    http://www.fastcgi.com

  A version more recent than 2.2.2 is needed.  If 2.2.3 or greater is
  not yet available, get one of the snapshots from October 6th or
  later:

    http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/

  Extract the archive and follow the directions in its 'INSTALL' file.
  Using the 'DSO' method is usually easiest.

  Next, Zope must be set up to use FastCGI.  You must decide whether
  you want to use FastCGI via a Unix domain socket or a TCP port.

  You will have to use a TCP port if you are using a Win32 box, or any
  other operating system that does not provide Unix domain sockets
  (sockets in the filesystem).  It is also the method you must use if
  Apache and Zope reside on different computers.  You will need to
  select a port number.  This is arbitrary, but it must not already be
  in use, and if you are not the super-user, it must be a sufficiently
  high number.  For illustrative purposes, I will use 8889.

  Unix domain sockets do not open a TCP port, which may be significant
  in some tight-security situation, but it requires slightly more
  setup, and so it is slightly less fool-proof.  You will need to
  select a location and filename for the socket.  Likely options are
  '/tmp/zope.soc' or within Zope's 'var' directory.  Make sure that
  both Zope and Apache will have adequate file permissions to read and
  write to the socket.  For illustrative purposes, I will use
  '/tmp/zope.soc'.

  The option to configure this is '-F (port #|socket filename)'.  Edit
  your 'start' script.  It's found in the root of your Zope
  installation, and it will look something like this::

#! /bin/sh
reldir=`dirname $0`
PYTHONHOME=`cd $reldir; pwd`
export PYTHONHOME
exec /usr/bin/python \
     $PYTHONHOME/z2.py \
     -D "$@"

  Insert a line before after '$PYTHONHOME/z2.py \'.  If you are using
  a TCP port, it will look like this::

     -F 8889 \

  If you are using a socket, the line will look like this::

     -F /tmp/zope.soc \

  The trailing backslash is significant!  You can start Zope at this
  point by running the 'start' script::

$ ./start

  Note that by default the start script starts Zope in debug mode, and
  so this command will not come back to a shell prompt until Zope
  exits.

  Next, Apache must be set up to pass FastCGI requests to Zope.  This
  is done with a 'FastCgiExternalServer' directive in Apache's
  httpd.conf.  By using 'FastCgiExternalServer' we are telling FastCGI
  that we'll be launching and killing the long-running process
  manually.  It goes at the beginning of 'Section 2'.  This directive
  will look like this for a TCP port configuration::

FastCgiExternalServer /PATH/TO/apache/htdocs/zope \
                      -host localhost:8889        \
                      -pass-header Authorization

  ...or like this for a socket configuration::

FastCgiIpcDir /tmp
FastCgiExternalServer /PATH/TO/apache/htdocs/zope \
                      -socket zope.soc            \
                      -pass-header Authorization

  The FastCgiIpcDir directive is needed to tell FastCGI where to find
  the socket file.  By default, FastCGI will look in /tmp/fcgi.  You
  *cannot* specify a full path with the '-socket' option, only a
  filename within the FastCgiIpcDir.

  The first argument after the directive name is confusing.  Apache
  maps URLs to directories and files within your 'DocumentRoot'.  You
  must specify the name of a file within your DocumentRoot directory,
  but that file need not (and probably should not) actually exist.
  When Apache tries to serve that file, it will instead send the
  request through FastCGI.  Make sense?

  Say, for instance, you want zope to be accessible from this URL:

    http://myserver.org/myzope

  Suppose further that you have Apache installed at /usr/local/apache.
  The directive would have to look like this::

FastCgiExternalServer /usr/local/apache/htdocs/myzope \
                      ...
                      ...

  The next argument depends on whether you are using a TCP port or a
  socket.  Note that the -host (port) argument requires the hostname.
  In the example, it's the same host as Apache runs on, but this need
  not be the case.  If you are using a socket, make sure Apache has
  the appropriate privileges to find it.

  The last argument, '-pass-header Authorization', tells FastCGI to
  pass the Authorization headers to Zope.  Without this, you would not
  be able to use the Zope web management interface, or anything else
  that requires authorization.  (Note: This feature was not in
  mod_fastcgi 2.2.2)

  One more item must be added to the httpd.conf.  Below the
  'FastCgiExternServer' directive, enter the following::

<Location /zope>
 SetHandler fastcgi-script
</Location>

  ...changing '/zope' as appropriate.  Using the
  'http://myserver.org/myzope' example from above, it would look like
  this::

<Location /myzope>
 SetHandler fastcgi-script
</Location>

  This creates a special case for the location specified, telling
  Apache to let FastCGI handle the request.

  That is all that is needed.  Make sure Zope is running, start or
  restart Apache, and you are finished.


Using Zope in single-threaded mode with pcgi_publisher
------------------------------------------------------

  The installation process should create a 'Zope.cgi' PCGI file. Copy the
  'Zope.cgi' file to your web server's cgi-bin directory.
  
  On Unix you can also create a symbolic link to 'Zope.cgi' from your cgi-bin
  directory. For example::

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  At this point you should perform any other steps you web server
  requires to install and configure a CGI script.

  Note: For more information on PCGI check out Jeff Bauer's "PCGI pages", 
  http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/.

  When your Zope.cgi file is correctly configured as a CGI script with
  your web server, you are ready to access Zope through the web. You
  should point your browser at:

    'http://youmachine.example.com:8998/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/manage'

  (Your URL maybe be different depending on how your web server is
  configured.)

  You should be prompted to enter a username and password. Enter the Zope
  "super manager" name and password.

Zope authentication with existing web servers
---------------------------------------------

  Zope normally performs both authentication and authorization of
  users.  Some web servers don't pass authentication information to
  CGI scripts.  If you keep getting rejected when you try to access
  Zope through the web with the "super manager" user name and
  password, there is a good chance that your web server is not passing
  authentication information to Zope.

  Getting Apache to pass authentication headers

    Before attempting to use your own Apache with Zope, it is highly
    recommended that you look at Zap.  Zap is a preconfigured and
    precompiled version of Apache for Linux that drops right into Zope
    with no hassles.  Even if you want to use your own Apache, or if
    you use it on a different platform than Linux, it is very helpful
    to have Zap's 'httpd.conf' file to guide you through configuring
    Apache.

    Zap can be found on the Zope website at:

      http://www.zope.org/Download/Releases/Zap-1.1.0

    If you are using Apache you will need to convince Apache to pass
    authentication headers to Zope. The easiest way to do this with
    Apache 1.3 and above is to use mod_rewrite. Here is an example of
    configuration information which you would place in an Apache conf
    file::

      # Zope configuration maps /Zope/ to the Zope.cgi CGI script
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
      RewriteRule ^/Zope/(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/$1 [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]

    Note that the RewriteRule should be one long line, and that the last
    character is the letter l, not the number 1.

    For Apache servers version 1.3b4 and above, there is an alternate way 
    to get the server to pass through authorization headers, but you must
    have the ability to recompile your Apache server binary. If you pass
    the flag -DSECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION when compiling the server,
    the resulting Apache binary will allow authorization headers to pass
    through to CGI programs and you can avoid using the Rewrite rules
    described above.


  Allowing your server to handle authentication itself

    Sometimes you may prefer to handle authentication outside Zope, for
    example if your web server already does complex authorization, or
    if it seems too difficult to convince it to pass authentication
    information to Zope.

    As of 1.9, Zope began supporting a mode that allowed the web
    server to handle authentication.  The 'REMOTE_USER' environment
    variable is then matched to the identity of a user object in Zope.

    The following provide step-by-step instructions for setting this
    up in Apache, allowing both the Zope "super manager" defined in
    the Zope 'access' file and users defined in Zope User Folders to
    be authenticated via the web server.

      Get Apache to authenticate /cgi-bin/Zope

        Add a directive in your Apache configuration file such as::

         <Location /cgi-bin/Zope/>
         AuthType Basic
         AuthName Zope-realm
         AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/ru_users
         require valid-user
         </Location>

        Then send Apache a '-1' signal to tell it to re-read its
        configuration files.

        *Note*: The above presumes that '/cgi-bin/Zope' has been made
        executable by some other Apache directive in the configuration
        file.

      Ensure Apache has 'superuser'

        Using Apache's tools for managing a user database, make 
        sure that the 'AuthUserFile' defined above has a valid user 
        called 'superuser'.

      Get Zope to use Apache's authentication

        Change Zope's access file to contain just the superuser
        id followed by a colon, as in::

          superuser:

        Note that this can be any value, including spaces.  The only
        restriction is that the value must match a user defined in
        Apache's user database.

        N.B.:  removing the password in the access file also enables
               access to the monitor for any user connecting through
               the localhost interface -- DISABLE THE MONITOR if using
               this option on any box which allows untrusted logins.

        Shut down Zope by doing::

          kill `cat var/Main.pid`

        from the Zope directory.

      Configure Zope

        At this point you are able to log in using the "superuser"
        identity.  If you want other people defined in the Apache user
        database to have identities in Zope, you need to add them to
        a User Folder (the object whose ID is acl_users). Either click on
        the pre-defined acl_users in the top folder or add a User Folder
        object to a subfolder.
  
  Specific web servers
  
    Apache
    
      * As mentioned above, Apache does not pass authorization
      information to CGI scripts by default. See above for information
      on how to deal with this situation.
 
      * An Apache module to support PCGI (mod_pcgi) is under
        development.
 
    Netscape Servers
  
      * Like Apache, Netscape does not pass HTTP Authorization
      information to CGI scripts.  We have a plugin at our website
      that addresses this.  http://www.digicool.com
  
      * Alternatively, you can allow the web server to perform the
      authentication step. See above for more information.
      
    IIS
  
      * You must turn off Windows NT Challenge/Response
      authentication.  To do this, go to IIS Manager, right-click on
      the server, select Service Properties, and deselect *both*
      'Windows NT Challenge/Response' and, strangely, Basic
      Authentication from the Password Authentication area of the
      Service tabbed worksheet.
  
      * IIS kindly throws out PATH_INFO when writing to its logs, so if
      you want to log which Zope objects are actually being
      accessed, you will need to investigate an ISAPI filter

      * An ISAPI module to support PCGI is under development.

      * IIS 4.0 throws away Zope's error messages by default. This 
        behavior can create quite a few problems, including authentication 
        problems.

      Microsoft prides itself on the clear error messages that IIS 4.0 
      presents, when the user makes a mistake. These error messages are 
      implemented in the form of Custom Error handlers, that return a file, 
      or URL to a user when a certain error occurs.

      This means, that when you forget to fill in an Id when you want to 
      create, say, a new SQL Method, Zope's clear error message is replaced 
      by IIS's totally irrelevant error message. Also, it completely breaks 
      authentication when the user uses IE5.0 when trying to log into a secure 
      area of the server. These Custom Error handlers are enabled by default.

      Luckily, the handlers can quite easily be switched off:

      Open the IIS website in the Management Console, and navigate to the 
      folder you put the PCGI executable in. If you named your Zope installation 
      'Zope', it will be called 'Zope.exe'. Double-click on that file. A property 
      page will appear. Select the 'Custom Errors' tab. Now, select every HTTP 
      Error code in the listbox that doesn't have type 'Default', and click on 
      the 'Set to Default' button for each one. This will disable IIS overriding 
      the error message returned by Zope.

      Click OK, and voila, Zope is allowed to tell the world what it thinks went
      wrong.
