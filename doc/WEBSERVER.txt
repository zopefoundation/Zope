Using Zope with an existing web server
--------------------------------------

  While Zope comes with a web server, you may wish to use it with an
  existing web server.  Use Persistent CGI (PCGI) to allow your
  existing web server to work with Zope on Unix and Windows.

  Roughly, PCGI is a protocol for translating CGI requests from a web
  server into Zope requests.  CGI requests are traditionally one shot
  events; the web server handles a request for a CGI script by
  spawning a new process to handle the requests, returning the results
  of the request when the process dies.

  Zope is a long running process, which means that it does not start
  up and die on each request like traditional CGI programs.  If it
  did, each request would take far too long due to the time to start
  and stop an application server like Zope.  Thus, PCGI is one of the
  options for gatewaying from the separate CGI processes to the Zope
  long running process.

Using Zope in multi-threaded mode with ZServer
----------------------------------------------

  ZServer is a general purpose TCP server for publishing Zope objects
  over various transport protocols.  For Zope to run multi-threaded,
  you must run ZServer.

  ZServer is based on Sam Rushing's Medusa software.  The benefit of
  using Medusa as the ZServer core is that it is not protocol specific
  (Medusa provides libraries to program for any protocol) and it is
  easily extensible.  Because Medusa is written in Python, is
  extremely high performance by design, and comes with an HTTP and FTP
  server, we chose it for the Zope core.

  It is not necessary, however, for ZServer to actually listen for
  incoming HTTP requests.  If you want Apache to do the actual
  listening and serving, then you can use ZServer's PCGI component to
  communicate with Apache.

  To run ZServer with PCGI, you must specify the -p option to the
  'z2.py' startup script.  From the top level Zope directory, you
  can::

    bash% python1.5.2 z2.py -p

  Note, you must have gone through the directions in 'INSTALL.txt' for
  this to work.

  This command will start ZServer up with PCGI (by default, it will
  also start up an HTTP and FTP server).  For PCGI to work, the
  webserver and Zope must agree on a PCGI resource file.  If this file
  is not named 'Zope.cgi' and is not in the same directory as 'z2.py',
  then you can specify the file name after the '-p', like::

    bash% python.1.5.2 z2.py -p /path/to/PCGI/resource/file

  Now the Zope long running process is started up, and the PCGI
  component is loaded and ready to receive CGI requests from your
  webserver.  

  The installation process should create a 'Zope.cgi' PCGI file. Copy
  the 'Zope.cgi' file to your web server's 'cgi-bin' directory.
  
  On Unix you can also create a symbolic link to 'Zope.cgi' from your
  cgi-bin directory. For example::

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  At this point you should perform any other steps you web server
  requires to install and configure a CGI script.

  Note: For more information on PCGI check out Jeff Bauer's "PCGI pages", 
  http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/.

  When your Zope.cgi file is correctly configured as a CGI script with
  your web server, you are ready to access Zope through the web. You
  should point your browser at:

    'http://youmachine.example.com:8998/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/manage'

  (Your URL maybe be different depending on how your web server is configured.)

  You should be prompted to enter a username and password.  Enter the
  Zope "super manager" name and password.

  Note: Apache requires some tricky configuration to get it to pass
  the HTTP authentication header information to Zope.  See the section 
  'Zope authentication with existing web servers'.


Using Zope in single-threaded mode with pcgi_publisher
------------------------------------------------------

  The installation process should create a 'Zope.cgi' PCGI file. Copy the
  'Zope.cgi' file to your web server's cgi-bin directory.
  
  On Unix you can also create a symbolic link to 'Zope.cgi' from your cgi-bin
  directory. For example::

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  At this point you should perform any other steps you web server
  requires to install and configure a CGI script.

  Note: For more information on PCGI check out Jeff Bauer's "PCGI pages", 
  http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/.

  When your Zope.cgi file is correctly configured as a CGI script with
  your web server, you are ready to access Zope through the web. You
  should point your browser at:

    'http://youmachine.example.com:8998/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/manage'

  (Your URL maybe be different depending on how your web server is
  configured.)

  You should be prompted to enter a username and password. Enter the Zope
  "super manager" name and password.

Zope authentication with existing web servers
---------------------------------------------

  Zope normally performs both authentication and authorization of
  users.  Some web servers don't pass authentication information to
  CGI scripts.  If you keep getting rejected when you try to access
  Zope through the web with the "super manager" user name and
  password, there is a good chance that your web server is not passing
  authentication information to Zope.

  Tricking Apache to pass authentication headers

    Before attempting to use your own Apache with Zope, it is highly
    recommended that you look at Zap.  Zap is a preconfigured and
    precompiled version of Apache for Linux that drops right into Zope
    with no hassles.  Even if you want to use your own Apache, or if
    you use it on a different platform than Linux, it is very helpful
    to have Zap's 'httpd.conf' file to guide you through configuring
    Apache.

    Zap can be found on the Zope website at:

      http://www.zope.org/Download/Releases/Zap-1.1.0

    If you are using Apache you will need to trick Apache into passing
    authentication headers to Zope. The easiest way to do this with
    Apache 1.3 and above is to use mod_rewrite. Here is an example of
    configuration information which you would place in an Apache conf
    file::

      # Zope configuration maps /Zope/ to the Zope.cgi CGI script
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
      RewriteRule ^/Zope/(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/$1 [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]

    Note that the RewriteRule should be one long line, and that the last
    character is the letter l, not the number 1.

  Allowing your server to handle authentication itself

    Sometimes you may prefer to handle authentication outside Zope, for
    example if your web server already does complex authorization, or
    if it seems too difficult to convince it to pass authentication
    information to Zope.

    As of 1.9, Zope began supporting a mode that allowed the web
    server to handle authentication.  The 'REMOTE_USER' environment
    variable is then matched to the identity of a user object in Zope.

    The following provide step-by-step instructions for setting this
    up in Apache, allowing both the Zope "super manager" defined in
    the Zope 'access' file and users defined in Zope User Folders to
    be authenticated via the web server.

      Get Apache to authenticate /cgi-bin/Zope

	Add a directive in your Apache configuration file such as::

	 <Location /cgi-bin/Zope/>
	 AuthType Basic
	 AuthName Zope-realm
	 AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/ru_users
	 require valid-user
	 </Location>

	Then send Apache a '-1' signal to tell it to re-read its
	configuration files.

	*Note*: The above presumes that '/cgi-bin/Zope' has been made
	executable by some other Apache directive in the configuration
	file.

      Ensure Apache has 'superuser'

	Using Apache's tools for managing a user database, make 
	sure that the 'AuthUserFile' defined above has a valid user 
	called 'superuser'.

      Get Zope to use Apache's authentication

	Change Zope's access file to contain just the superuser
	id followed by a colon, as in::

	  superuser:

	Note that this can be any value, including spaces.  The only
	restriction is that the value must match a user defined in
	Apache's user database.

	Shut down Zope by doing::

	  kill `cat var/Main.pid`

	from the Zope directory.

      Configure Zope

	At this point you are able to log in using the "superuser"
	identity.  If you want other people defined in the Apache user
	database to have identities in Zope, you need to add them to
	a User Folder (the object whose ID is acl_users). Either click on
	the pre-defined acl_users in the top folder or add a User Folder
	object to a subfolder.
  
  Specific web servers
  
    Apache
    
      * As mentioned above, Apache does not pass authorization
      information to CGI scripts by default. See above for information
      on how to deal with this situation.
 
      * An Apache module to support PCGI (mod_pcgi) is under
        development.
 
    Netscape Servers
  
      * Like Apache, Netscape does not pass HTTP Authorization
      information to CGI scripts.  We have a plugin at our website
      that addresses this.  http://www.digicool.com
  
      * Alternatively, you can allow the web server to perform the
      authentication step. See above for more information.
      
    IIS
  
      * You must turn off Windows NT Challenge/Response
      authentication.  To do this, go to IIS Manager, right-click on
      the server, select Service Properties, and deselect *both*
      'Windows NT Challenge/Response' and, strangely, Basic
      Authentication from the Password Authentication area of the
      Service tabbed worksheet.
  
      * IIS kindly throws out PATH_INFO when writing to its logs, so if
      you want to log which Zope objects are actually being
      accessed, you will need to investigate an ISAPI filter

      * An ISAPI module to support PCGI is under development.
