Using Zope with an existing web server
--------------------------------------

  While Zope comes with a web server, you may wish to use it with an
  existing web server. Use Persistent CGI (PCGI) to allow your existing
  web server to work with Zope on Unix and Windows.

  The installation process should create a 'Zope.cgi' PCGI file. Copy the
  'Zope.cgi' file to your web server's cgi-bin directory.
  
  On Unix you can also create a symbolic link to 'Zope.cgi' from your cgi-bin
  directory. For example::

    ln -s /home/amos/Zope/Zope.cgi /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope

  At this point you should perform any other steps you web server
  requires to install and configure a CGI script.

  Note: For more information on PCGI check out Jeff Bauer's "PCGI pages", 
  http://starship.skyport.net/crew/jbauer/persistcgi/.

  When your Zope.cgi file is correctly configured as a CGI script with
  your web server, you are ready to access Zope through the web. You should
  point your browser at:

    'http://youmachine.example.com:8998/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/manage'

  (Your URL maybe be different depending on how your web server is configured.)

  You should be prompted to enter a username and password. Enter the Zope
  "super manager" name and password.

  Two ways to support PCGI

    There are two ways to handle PCGI requests with Zope.

    Using PCGI Publisher

      By default, accessing Zope.cgi from your web server will
      automatically cause a Python script, pcgi_publisher, to run.
      This is a single-threaded application that serves PCGI requests
      one at a time.  The script will run as whatever user (and with
      whatever group) your web server uses to run CGI requests.

    Using ZServer

      The Zope 2 start script, z2.py will run ZServer and serve PCGI
      requests by default.  ZServer is a multi-threaded server that
      can simultaneously support multiple protocols, including PCGI,
      HTTP, and FTP.  If Zope is started by root (on Unix) with z2.py,
      then the Server will run as nobody, otherwise it will run as
      whatever user ran z2.py. You can configure ZServer to run as a
      specific userid using the '-u' switch.

  Zope authentication with existing web servers.

    Zope normally performs both authentication and authorization of users.
    Some web servers don't pass authentication information to CGI scripts.
    If you keep getting rejected when you try to access Zope through the
    web with the "super manager" user name and password, there is a good chance
    that your web server is not passing authentication information to Zope.
  
    Tricking Apache to pass authentication headers
  
      If you are using Apache you will need to trick Apache into passing
      authentication headers to Zope. The easiest way to do this with 
      Apache 1.3 and above is to use mod_rewrite. Here is an example of
      configuration information which you would place in an Apache conf file::
  
	# Zope configuration maps /Zope/ to the Zope.cgi CGI script
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  ^(.*)
	RewriteRule ^/Zope/(.*) /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/Zope.cgi/$1 [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]
  
      Note that the RewriteRule should be one long line, and that the last
      character is the letter l, not the number 1.
  
    Allowing your server to handle authentication itself
   
      Sometimes you may prefer to handle authentication outside Zope, for
      example if your web server already does complex authorization, or
      if it seems too difficult to convince it to pass authentication
      information to Zope.
  
      As of 1.0.9, Zope began supporting a mode that allowed the web
      server to handle authentication.  The 'REMOTE_USER' environment
      variable is then matched to the identity of a user object in
      Zope.
  
      The following provide step-by-step instructions for setting this up in
      Apache, allowing both the Zope "super manager" defined in the Zope
      'access' file and users defined in Zope User Folders to be authenticated
      via the web server.
  
	Get Apache to authenticate /cgi-bin/Zope
  
	  Add a directive in your Apache configuration file such as::
  
	   <Location /cgi-bin/Zope/>
	   AuthType Basic
	   AuthName Zope-realm
	   AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/ru_users
	   require valid-user
	   </Location>
  
	  Then send Apache a '-1' signal to tell it to re-read its
	  configuration files.  *Note*: the above presumes that
	  '/cgi-bin/Zope' has been made executable by some other Apache
	  directive in the configuration file.
  
	Ensure Apache Has 'superuser'
  
	  Using Apache's tools for managing a user database, make 
	  sure that the 'AuthUserFile' defined above has a valid user 
	  called 'superuser'.
  
	Get Zope to use Apache's authentication
  
	  Change Zope's access file to contain just the superuser
	  id followed by a colon, as in::
  
	    superuser:
  
	  Note that this can be any value, including spaces.  The only
	  restriction is that the value must match a user defined in
	  Apache's user database.
  
	  Shut down Zope by doing::
  
	    kill `cat var/Main.pid`
  
	  from the Zope directory.
  
	Configure Zope
  
	  At this point you are able to log in using the "superuser"
	  identity.  If you want other people defined in the Apache user
	  database to have identities in Zope, you need to add them to
	  a User Folder (the object whose ID is acl_users). Either click on
	  the pre-defined acl_users in the top folder or add a User Folder
	  object to a subfolder.
  
  Specific web servers
  
    Apache
    
      * As mentioned above, Apache does not pass authorization information
      to CGI scripts by default. See above for information on how to deal
      with this situation.
 
      * An Apache module to support PCGI (mod_pcgi) is under development.
 
    Netscape Servers
  
      * Like Apache, Netscape does not pass HTTP Authorization information to
      CGI scripts.  We have a plugin at our website that addresses this.
      http://www.digicool.com
  
      * Alternatively, you can allow the web server to perform the
      authentication step. See above for more information.
      
    IIS
  
      * You must turn off Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication.
      To do this, go to IIS Manager, right-click on the server, select
      Service Properties, and deselect *both* 'Windows NT
      Challenge/Response' and, strangely, Basic Authentication from the
      Password Authentication area of the Service tabbed worksheet.
  
      * IIS kindly throws out PATH_INFO when writing to its logs, so if
      you want to log which Zope objects are actually being
      accessed, you will need to investigate an ISAPI filter

      * An ISAPI module to support PCGI is under development.
