    Zope 2.3.0 alpha 1
    
      Features Added

        - Added the __replaceable__ property support to ObjectManager.
            This is currently documented only in the Wiki.

        - Added unit tests for the DateTime module.

        - Added new BASEPATHn and URLPATHn variables in the REQUEST
          object, and changed Zope core DTML files to use BASEPATH1
          instead of SCRIPT_NAME.

        - Added new getId() method to SimpleItem.Item. This should 
          now be used instead of referencing 'object.id' directly, 
          as it is guaranteed to always be a method and to always 
          return the right thing regardless of how the id of the 
          object is stored internally.

        - Improved Ownership controls. Now you simply choose whether
          or not to take ownership of sub-objects when taking
          ownership. There is no need to control implicit/explicit
          ownership.

        - Changed the Zope installation procedure so it is only
          necessary to create one user account and that user is
          stored in the ZODB.

        - Implemented the "emergency user" concept, which is the new
          name for what was called the superuser.
        
        - Added new "WebDAV source view" HTTP handler, enabled by new
          '-W' (note uppercase) switch to z2.py.  This handler is *not*
          enabled by default.

        - Implemented "hookable PUT creation" (allows containers to
          override webdav.NullResource's guess at the type of object
          to create when PUT is done to an unknown ID).

        - Added testrunner.py to the utilities directory. The testrunner 
          is a basic utility for running PyUnit based unit tests. It can 
          be used to run all tests found in the Zope tree, all test suites
          in a given directory or in specific files. The testrunner will 
          be used to ensure that all checked in tests pass before releases 
          are made. For more information, see the docstring of the actual
          testrunner.py module.

      Bugs Fixed

        - (Collector #1650)Where the underlying object does not define
          its own '__cmp__()', comparisons of acquisition-wrapped
          objects fall back to comparing the identities *of the
          wrappers* .  Fixed to unrwap the object (both, if needed)
          before comparing identities.

        - (Collector #1687 Products which register base classes
          for ZClasses typically defer creating them until product
          registration;  the derived ZClass needs them to be available
          immediately after import.  Deprecated
          'ProductContext.registerZClass' and
          'ProductContext.registerBaseClass' in favor of a new function,
          'ZClasses.createZClassForBase' (because none of the machinery
          needed a ProductContext instance anyway).

        - (Collector #1355) Fixed overlapping HTTP POST requests in
          ZServer which could have been corrupted. Thanks to Jeff
          Ragsdale. 

        - Undid a bug fix that caused the DateTime unit tests to fail.

        - Removed the requirement that an "access" file exist.
          "access" is now only needed to create an emergency user
          account.

        - Disabled the monitor port by default because, initially,
          there is no emergency user, and thus no password that
          can be used to protect the port.

        - Secured the hole that was patched by Hotfix_2000-12-08.

        - Disallowed object IDs that end with two underscores.

        - Caused PropertyManager to restrict id's the same way
          ObjectManager does.
