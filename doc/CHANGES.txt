    Zope 2.3.0 alpha 2

      Features Added

        - The install machinery for source release has been modified 
          to allow Zope to build out of the box for Python 2.0. Note 
          however, that Python 2.0 is still not officially supported. 
          You may see quite a few warnings from the extension builder 
          when compiling for Python 2.

        - A new module, AccessControl.Permissions has been added to 
          make it easier to use the new security assertion spelling. 
          The new module provides consistent symbolic constants for 
          the standard Zope permissions.

        - Cache manager support added.  This allows site administrators
          to ease the burden on their site in a very configurable
          way.  It also provides an API for developers to follow when
          experimenting with caching strategies.

        - The ZPublisher 'method' form variable type has been 
          deprecated in favor of 'action'. The behavior is the 
          same, only the official (and documented in the Zope
          book) name has changed. The 'method' name is still 
          supported for backward compatibility.

        - The 'objectIds' and 'objectValues' methods of ObjectManager
          derived objects are no longer directly Web-accessible. This 
          is a topic that has come up over and over on the lists. Some 
          (xml-rpc, mostly) users may depend on this behavior - applications
          that need access to this information remotely should be modified 
          so that a Python Script or DTML Method can explicitly pass 
          the data. 
          
        - The Image.tag() and ZopeAttributionButton methods now return an
          image tag that is XHTML compatible; a space and a slash have been
          added.

        - SQLMethods can now be edited via FTP and WebDAV tools. Thanks to 
          Anthony Baxter for his FTP support patches.

        - The Catalog has been slightly overhauled to manage object
          paths instead of URLs in its tables.  This should not cause
          any backward compatability concern, but everyone upgrading
          should read the web pages on the zope.org site at:
          http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZCatalogVirtualHostFix/UpgradeFAQ
          this will provide information about how to upgrade and new
          features on the result sets, like getObject and
          getPath. These are very important.
     
        - SiteAccess 2.0 has been added, to enable virtual hosting.

        - The StandardCacheManagers product has been added as a primary
          product, making it easier to get started with caching.

        - The class DTMLFile has been added alongside of HTMLFile.
          It supports name bindings, ignores positional parameters,
          and puts the container on top of the namespace by default.
          Most HTMLFiles should work the same (or more securely) if
          converted to a DTMLFile.  Most management interface methods
          should be converted by the final release of 2.3.

        - Added a variable called PUBLISHED to REQUEST.  From now on,
          this variable should be used instead of PARENTS for user
          validation.

        - The inituser file is now read even when one user has been
          created.  This provides a way to reset the password after
          a new user installs Zope but ignores the generated password.

        - ZCatalogs have a reduced number of management interface tabs.

        - ZCatalog keyword and field indexes have been modified to use
          a merge strategy when existing indexes are updated.  When an
          existing object is indexed, the contents of field and
          keyword indexes are merged with the changes detected between
          the existing contents of the index and the new content.

        - CatalogPathAware class added.  This will eventually replace
          CatalogAware.

        - The ManagementInterfaceQuickFix project was merged in. The 
          Zope management interface has been tweaked in various ways 
          to improve productivity and consistency and is now at least 
          slightly less ugly :)

      Bugs Fixed

        - A misspelled function name which prevented the addition of
          properties was corrected.

        - Caused PropertySheets to restrict IDs the same way
          ObjectManager does.

	- (Collector #1586) Fixed situation where the Catalog would
	  attempt to loop over a bucket as if it were a list, which
	  won't work.  This was reported by Steve Alexander with a
          patch. 

        - Corrected local role computation (Hotfix 2000-12-15)

        - The basic user folder implementation in User.py was changed
          to use the Zope security policy machinery.  see
          http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Proposals/
          ChangeUserFoldersToUseSecurityPolicyAPI for details.

        - Trying to cut or copy with no items selected now returns a 
          nicer error message.

        - A roles keyword argument was added to ZopeSecurityPolicy.validate
          to enable callers to pass in roles as opposed to allowing the
          machinery to figure it out for itself.

        - Some product context initialization related to setting roles
          was updated.

    Zope 2.3.0 alpha 1
    
      Features Added

        - Python Scripts are now part of the Zope core. Big whopping 
          kudos to Evan Simpson for all of the work he has put into 
          this! Having Python Scripts in the core will allow people 
          to much more easily separate logic and presentation (and 
          get that logic out of DTML!) More information and prototype 
          documentation for Python Scripts can be found in the 
          dev.zope.org project:

          http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/PythonMethods

        - Added the __replaceable__ property support to ObjectManager.
            This is currently documented only in the Wiki.

        - Added unit tests for the DateTime module.

        - Added new BASEPATHn and URLPATHn variables in the REQUEST
          object, and changed Zope core DTML files to use BASEPATH1
          instead of SCRIPT_NAME.

        - Added new getId() method to SimpleItem.Item. This should 
          now be used instead of referencing 'object.id' directly, 
          as it is guaranteed to always be a method and to always 
          return the right thing regardless of how the id of the 
          object is stored internally.

        - Improved Ownership controls. Now you simply choose whether
          or not to take ownership of sub-objects when taking
          ownership. There is no need to control implicit/explicit
          ownership.

        - Changed the Zope installation procedure so it is only
          necessary to create one user account and that user is
          stored in the ZODB. The user created at startup now is 
          simply a normal intial "Manager", not the "superuser". 
          It is no longer necessary to login, create an initial 
          manager, logout and log back in! Woohoo!

        - Implemented the "emergency user" concept, which is the new
          name for what was called the superuser. The emergency user 
          doesnt even exist now until you explicitly create it.
        
        - Added new "WebDAV source view" HTTP handler, enabled by new
          '-W' (note uppercase) switch to z2.py.  This handler is *not*
          enabled by default.

        - Implemented "hookable PUT creation" (allows containers to
          override webdav.NullResource's guess at the type of object
          to create when PUT is done to an unknown ID).

        - Added testrunner.py to the utilities directory. The testrunner 
          is a basic utility for running PyUnit based unit tests. It can 
          be used to run all tests found in the Zope tree, all test suites
          in a given directory or in specific files. The testrunner will 
          be used to ensure that all checked in tests pass before releases 
          are made. For more information, see the docstring of the actual
          testrunner.py module.

        - The Interface scarecrow package has been checked in - more work
          will likely be done on it before it goes into wide use. See 
          Michel's "Zope Interfaces" project on dev.zope.org for details:

          http://www.zope.org/Wikis/Interfaces/FrontPage

        - PyUnit has been checked into the core. Along with the testrunner,
          this provides enough infrastructure for us to incrementally begin 
          accumulating (and running!) test suites for various parts of the 
          Zope core.

        - The new security assertion support has been checked in. For 
          more information and an updated version of the "Zope security 
          for developers" guide see the project on dev.zope.org:

      Bugs Fixed

        - Removed some cruft in OFS/content_types.py (an old data
          structure was being constructed but was going unused in
          favor of a newer structure used in conjunction with the
          mimetypes module).

        - (Collector #1650)Where the underlying object does not define
          its own '__cmp__()', comparisons of acquisition-wrapped
          objects fall back to comparing the identities *of the
          wrappers* .  Fixed to unwrap the object (both, if needed)
          before comparing identities.

        - (Collector #1687 Products which register base classes
          for ZClasses typically defer creating them until product
          registration;  the derived ZClass needs them to be available
          immediately after import.  Deprecated
          'ProductContext.registerZClass' and
          'ProductContext.registerBaseClass' in favor of a new function,
          'ZClasses.createZClassForBase' (because none of the machinery
          needed a ProductContext instance anyway).

        - (Collector #1355) Fixed overlapping HTTP POST requests in
          ZServer which could have been corrupted. Thanks to Jeff
          Ragsdale. 

        - Undid a bug fix that caused the DateTime unit tests to fail.

        - Removed the requirement that an "access" file exist.
          "access" is now only needed to create an emergency user
          account.

        - Disabled the monitor port by default because, initially,
          there is no emergency user, and thus no password that
          can be used to protect the port.

        - Secured the hole that was patched by Hotfix_2000-12-08.

        - Disallowed object IDs that end with two underscores.

        - Caused PropertyManager to restrict id's the same way
          ObjectManager does.
