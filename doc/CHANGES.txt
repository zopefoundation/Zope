Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release.
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.

  To-do

   - Reenable C permission roles by implementing recent Python
     changes in C, brining the Python and C implementations back in
     sync.  See lib/python/AccessControl/PermissionRole.py.

   - Add cyclic-garbage collection support to C extension classes,
     especially to acquisition wrappers.

   - Reenable C Zope security policy by implementing recent Python
     changes in C, bringing the Python and C implementations back in
     sync.  See lib/python/AccessControl/ZopeSecurityPolicy.py.

   - Change acquisition wrappers to implement the descr get slot
     directly, thus speeding the use of the slot.

   - Collector #1233: port ZOPE_CONFIG patch from Zope 2.7 to Zope 2.8


  after Zope 2.9.0 beta 1 

    Bugs fixed

     - OFS ObjectManager: Fixed list_imports() to tolerate missing
       import directories.

     - Collector #1965: 'get_transaction' missing from builtins without
       sufficient deprecation notice (ZODB 3.6 properly removed it, but
       Zope needs to keep it for another release).

     - Several zope.app packages were forgotten to be included in the
       first beta due to the now zpkg-based build and release process.

    Features added

     - none, feature freeze :-)

  Zope 2.9.0 beta 1 (2005/12/06)

    Features added

      - ObjectManager now has an hasObject method to test presence. This
        brings it in line with BTreeFolder.

      - Using FastCGI is officially deprecated

      - Improved logging of ConflictErrors. All conflict errors are
        logged at INFO, with counts of how many occurred and how many
        were resolved. Tracebacks for all conflicts are logged a DEBUG
        level, although these won't help anyone much. If a conflict
        error is unresolved, it will now bubble up to error_log and
        standard_error_message.

      - Fixed unclear security declarations. Warn when an attempt is
        made to have a security declaration on a nonexistent method.

      - updated to ZPL 2.1

      - interfaces: Added 'Interfaces' tab to basic core objects.
        This is a Five feature and only available if the classes are made
        five:traversable. It allows to inspect interfaces and to assign
        marker interfaces through the ZMI.

      - webdav: Added support for the z3 WriteLock interface.
        It is no longer necessary to have the WriteLockInterface in the
        __implements__ list of lockable objects. All classes inheriting from
        LockableItem inherit also the IWriteLock interface. Note that this
        enables webdav locking for all subclasses by default even if they
        don't specify the WriteLockInterface explicitly.

      - App ProductContext: Made registerClass aware of z3 interfaces.
        Z2 and z3 interfaces are registered side by side in the same tuple in
        Products.meta_types. IFAwareObjectManagers like the ZCatalog work now
        with z3 interfaces as well.

      - Zope now sends Zope 3 events when objects are added or removed
        from standard containers. manage_afterAdd, manage_beforeDelete
        and manage_afterClone are now deprecated. See
        lib/python/Products/Five/tests/event.txt for details.

      - Zope now utilizes ZODB 3.6.  It had previously used
        ZODB 3.4.  As a result, the DBTab package was removed, as
        ZODB 3.6 has multidatabase support that makes DBTab
        unnecessary.

      - Added a 'product-config' section type to zope.conf, allowing
        arbitrary key-value mappings.  Products can look for such
        confgiurations to set product-specific options.  Products mwy
        also register their own section types, extending the
        'zope.product.base' type. (see the example '<product-config>'
        section in skel/etc/zope.conf.in for sample usage).

      - Collector #1490: Added a new zope.conf option to control the
        character set used to encode unicode data that reaches
        ZPublisher without any specified encoding.

      - AccessControl, Acquisition, App, OFS, webdav, PluginIndexes,
        ZCatalog and ZCTextIndex: Added some Zope 3 style interfaces.
        This makes the bridged interfaces shipped with Five obsolete.

      - ZConfig extension, address now also accepts symbolic port names
        from etc/services (unix) or etc\services (win32)

      - ZPublisher.HTTPRequest.FileUpload now supports full file
        object interface.  This means Iterator support was added. (for
        line in fileobject: ..., as well as fileobject.next() and
        fileobject.xreadlines() ) Collector #1837

      - Switched the bundled Zope 3 to release 3.2 and upgraded the
        Five product to version 1.3 (see Products/Five/CHANGES.txt).

      - The PageTemplate implementation now uses Zope 3 message
        catalogs by default for translation.  Old-style translation
        services such as Localizer or PlacelessTranslationService are
        still supported as fall-backs.  See Products/Five/doc/i18n.txt
        for more information.

      - Switched to the new improved test runner from Zope 3.  Run
        test.py with -h to find out more.

      - Collector #1904: On Mac OS X avoid a spurious OSError when
        zopectl exits.
