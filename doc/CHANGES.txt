Zope Changes

  This file gives information on changes made to Zope over time,
  things that need to be done before the next release and future
  plans.

  Notes on Zope 2.0

    ZOPE 2.0 REQUIRES PYTHON 1.5.2!

    Zope 2 includes:

      - ZODB 3, the next generation of the Zope Object Database,

      - Z Classes, a new mechanism for building Zope applications

      - WebDAV level 1 support,

      - Support for XML-RPC clients.

      - ZServer, the integration of Zope and Medusa,

      - Beginnings of XML support
  
        o The Python pyexpat extension, which provides access to the
          widely used expat XML parsing library, is included in the
          distribution.	
  
        o DOM interface on Zope objects (initially this is limited to
          read-only access).
  
        o Import/export using XML
  
        Of course, XML is used in XML-RPC and WebDAV

      - Many other sundry big significant items, such as:

        o Look and feel improvements,

        o Tighter security,

        o Simpler creation of Python products.

    ZODB 3

      See ZODB.txt for notes on ZODB 3.

    ZClasses

      ZClasses provide a powerful new way to develop Zope
      applications.  ZClasses allow new objects to be developed
      entirely through the web.  

      ZClasses also support building applications through combinations
      of Python classes created on the file system and objects created
      through the web.  For example, Python classes could implemented
      business/domain logic and then augmented with Zope web methods
      to provide a web interface.

    Zope 2.0 Road-map

      In short
 
        We expect to provide a stable Zope 2.0 release in
        mid August.

      Zope 2.0 releases

        We expect to make two beta releases in early August 1999 followed
        by a final release in mid August.

  Releases

    Zope 2.0 beta 2

      Features added

        - Added a '-r' switch to z2.py for ZServer read-only mode.

        - The 'null' attribute in the DTML 'var' tag is now used when
          the value being output if the Python value 'None'. Some
          people considered this to be a bug.

        - Permission objects are automatically created for new ZClass
          objects. 

      Bugs fixed

        - Conflict errors, which occur when simultanious writes occur
          to the same object in multiple database connections, are now
          handled correctly by re-executing (up to three times)
          the requests that lost the race condition.

        - Error formatting with standard_error_message has been moved
          to the object publisher via a new published module hook,
          'zpublisher_exception_hook'.  In addition to enabling
          conflict error handling, this fixed two other bugs:

           - Error handling in ExternalMethods and in DTML methods or
             documents called from other DTML documents or methods
             caused errors to be propigated in ways that defeated use of
             the try tag and other forms of error handling.

           - Errors raised before or after calling published objects
             were not formatted.

        - Errors in processing form variables, such as missing or
          miss-typed values resulted in server errors, rather than in
          formatted error reports.

        - Database browsing didn't work for ZGadflyDA database adapters.

        - Transaction meta data were not captured correctly by
          ZPublisher, which made the undo log look odd wrt the user
          who performed the transaction.

        - Permissions for version operations were not set correctly. This
          made it hard to delegate work to be done in versions and to
          separate version participation from version finalization.
          To fix this, it was necessary to split the "Join/Leave" view
          into separate "Join/Leave" and "Save/Discard" views.

        - No remark could be entered when discarding versions.
        
        - Fixed a ZServer kill_zombies bug which kept ZServer from killing
          hung connections.
      
        - Fixed a product permissions registration bug that allowed
          product permission data to get lost.

        - Objects were sometimes incorrectly acquired do a bug in
          detecting attribte errors during acquisition. This led to
          errors getting covered up or obscured.

        - There was a memory leak in acquisition.

        - Some thread-safety problems were fixed.

        - DTML entity references (e.g. '&dtml-spam;') with missing
          semicolons  (e.g. '&dtml-spam') caused infinite loops.

        - Extra spaces around expressions in DTML caused syntax errors.

        - Broken objects, which are used as surrogates for objects
          that can no longer be instantiated due to missing product
          installations, no longer use HTML markup in their text
          representation, as this caused odd effects in HTML titles.

        - A number of fixes were made to the new DOM support.
  
        - Versions could be deleted by users working in the deleted
          versions. This led to strange paradoxical effects.  Attempts
          to delete a version or an object containing a version by
          someone working in a version now lead to errors.

        - ZGadflyDA has been updated to use the current (as of this
          release) version of Gadfly. (Note that this had been
          incorrectly reported as a 2.0 beta 1 feature.)

        - Using an sql method in a version sometimes caused the method
          to be locked, making it unusable by non-version users. This
          was due to the way that column meta-data was managed.  Now
          column meta-data, used by report creation wizards, is only
          safed when sql methods are tested.

        - In StructuredText, list items could not directly introduce
          example code.

        - Undoing transactions that discarded versions did not cause
          versions to appear non-empty.

        - Temporary files were created for file storages that were
          opened in read-only mode.

      Note:

        The section for Zope 2.0 alpha 4 did not mention that ZCatalog 
        is now shipped with the Zope core.

    Zope 2.0 beta 1

      Backward incompatibility

        - ZODB 2 is no longer supported or included!

        - The utility script bbb.py, no longer supports
          xml output.
    
      Known problems

        - Handling of conflict errors hasn't been implemented.  When
          two threads try to update the same object, one will get a
          conflict error. By beta release 2, requests that get conflct
          errors will be retried until they succeed (or fail without a
          conflict error) or until a maximum number of retries is
          exceeded.

      Features added
      
        - The default ports used by ZServer have been changed. The
          new default ports are: 8080 for HTTP, 8021 for FTP and
          8099 for the monitor server.

        - ZServer now uses the zLOG logging mechanism for informational and
          warning messages.
      
        - ZServer now includes a fairly stable NT service ZService.py

        - 'access' file now can use SHA-1 hashing, and now does by
          default

        - 'zpasswd.py' added to top directory to manage this
          new 'access' file

        - A number of changes have been made to enhance security
          control in through-the-web-developed products:

          - There are new "Permission" objects that can be added to 
            Products.  Permission objects provide a mechanism for
            defining new permissions. These new permissions show up in
            folder security screens.

          - Factory objects can have permission settings. This affects
            whether items show up in add lists and who can use factories.

          - Objects in products now have permission mapping rather
            than direct permission settings just like ZClass methods.

          - New permissions cannot be defined in ZClasses any longer.
            Rather, ZClasses can select from global permissions,
            including permissions defined with permission objects.

          Here's a sample scenario:

            1. Add a ZClass, "Container" with the option to create a
               factory and constructor methods.

            2. Add a permission object with the permission "Manage
               Containers".

            3. Change the permission of the factory created in step 1
               to "Manage Containers".

            4. Visit the ZClass created in step 1, view the "Define
               Permissions" view and map the "Create class instances"
               permission to "Manage Containers".

            5. Visit the constructor DTML Methods created in step 1,
               view the "Define Permissions" view and map the "View"
               permission to "Manage Containers".

          In this scenario, we created a ZClass and made it addable
          only by users (roles) that have the "Manage Containers" permission.

        - There is a new module, Shared.DC.THUNK
          (lib/python/Shared/DC/THUNK.py) that provides a mix-in class
          that implements ZODB 3 transaction protocols and that
          provides course-grained locking logic that should allow many
          non-thread-safe database adapters to be usable in
          multi-threaded Zope applications.  The Gadfly database
          adapter has been updated to use this mix-in class.

        - The transaction management mix-in classes (Shared.DC.TM.TM
          and Shared.DC.THUNK.THUNKED_TM) now provide a lower-level
          transaction management protocol.  Database adapters that mix
          these in should:

            - Call 'self._register()' when performing database
              queries, and

            - If necessary, override methods:

                _begin() -- Which is called to begin a transaction,

                _finish() -- Which is called to finish a transaction,
                             and save changes, or

                _abort() -- Which is called to abort (rollback) a transaction,
                            and discard changes, or

        - Object export now provides an XML export option and import
          files may be in Zope export format or XML format.

        - Zope objects that suport the Zope management framework now
          support the DOM 1.0 read interfaces.  This allows DOM read
          methods and attributes to be usable with Zope objects and
          Python DOM tools, like FourThought's 4XSL to work with Zope
          objects.  

          Note that DOM-defined attributes are defined with "get"
          methods. For example, to get the DOM-defined "parentNode"
          attribute, use: 'object.getParentNode()'.

        - The pyexpat extension module for using James Clark's 
          expat library for parsing XML is included in the
          distribution as Shared.DC.pyexpat.

      Bugs Fixed
      
        - You can no longer cd to an acquired directory in ZServer FTP.

        - A number of changes were made for thread safety.  This was not as
          hard as it sounds, since persistent objects are always
          thread-safe. (Well, only one thread accesses any particular
          copy of a persistent object.)  The biggest issue here is
          mutable global variables, mutable objects stored in classes, 
          mutable default Python function arguments, and global
          variables in extensions.

    Zope 2.0 alpha 4

      Backward incompatibility

        - The old ZopeHTTPServer is no longer supported or included.
          Use ZServer.

      Features added

        - The let and return tags were added to DTML.

        - Several new inpt form types were added:

            :default -- allows you to specify default values

            :record -- allows you to combine multiple form variables
                       into a single inot variable.
 
                For example::

                   <input name="date.year:record:int">
                   <input name="date.month:record:int">
                   <input name="date.day:record:int">

                will result in a single variable, 'date', with
                attributes 'year', 'month', and 'day'.

            :records -- allows you to input a list of records (ie a
                        table)

            :ignore-empty -- If the field if the value is an empty
                             string.

          For more information, see the section on "Form variable
          types" in http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Reference/Trinkets.

        - In the startup script, z2.py:

        - The startup script, z2.py, has additional documentation on
          providing empty strings as arguments.
    
        - Added a -P option to the startup script, z2.py, to specify a
          base port for the various servers. For example::
        
            python z2.py -P8000 
        
              is equivalent to:
        
            python z2.py -w8080 -f8021 -m8099
        
              This is a convenient short-hand for systes with many zserver
              instances running.
    
        - Added an -l option to the startup script, z2.py, to specify
          the location of the ZServer hit log. If the location is a
          relative path, then it is assumed to be rooted in the 'var'
          directory.

        - A progress indicator was added to the database conversion
          utility, utilities/bbb.py.

        - The PCGI installer now writes the PCGI info file to use ZODB 3
          rather than ZODB 2.
    
        - The default content is provided in both ZODB 2 and ZODB 3
          format.

        - There is a new logging framework for reporting errors from
          Python-level code.  See the module zLOG.py for details.

          For the time being, to turn on logging, set the environment
          variable STUPID_LOG_FILE to a file name or to an empty
          string to log to standard error.  We will eventually provide
          a more formal and functional logging configuration
          interface.

        - The hooks used by objects that modify their environment were
          changed.  The new hooks are:

            manage_addHook -- called after an object has been added

            manage_beforeDelete -- called before an object is deleted

            manage_afterClone -- called after an object has been
               copied. This should only be used by object that 
               capture their identity is some way other than their 
               id attribute or persistent id. (It's really for
               ZClasses, which have global ids.)
 
        - Pack is now supported for ZODB3 File Storages.
    
        - The header output by manage_tabs now shows whether the
          current object has been modified or locked by a version and
          shows the version if the version isn't the current working
          version. 
    
            - The locked-in-version decoration in the object management
              contents view shows the locking version if the version isn't
              the current working version.
    
            - Several demonstration ZODB Storage implementations have been
              added. See lib/python/ZODB/DemoStorage.py and
              lib/python/ZODB/dbmStorage.py.
    
        - Subtransactions have been added (instead of temporary
          versions). If a true argument is given in a transaction commit
          or abort call (e.g. 'get_transaction().commit(1)'), then
          the commit or abort applies to a subtransaction of the
          current transaction.  This is useful in a number of ways,
          including:
    
                o Subtransaction commits on requests that work with lots
                  of data can reduce memory usage because data can be
                  removed from memory after changes are saved in a
                  subtransaction, 
    
                o You can rollback changes due to a local error without
                  rolling back *all* of the changes made in a long
                  transaction. 

        - There is an advanced interface for specifying alternate
          storages for Zope.  Zope will try to import the module
          'custom_zodb' from INSTANCE_HOME and use it's Storage
          attribute. 

          For example, to use a Demo storage based on the standard
          File storage, yo might define a 'custom_zodb' module with::

            import Globals, ZODB.FileStorage, ZODB.DemoStorage

            name='%s/Data.fs' % Globals.data_dir

            base=ZODB.FileStorage.FileStorage(name, read_only=1)
            Storage=ZODB.DemoStorage.DemoStorage("Demo (%s)" % name, base)

        - Find can now search text of SQL methods.

        - DTML tree tags now have a reverse option.

        - ZClasses now have class ids.  These class ids are registered
          in a central registry and are used when unpicking instances.

        - Database connections now have a sync method for
          synchronizing the connection with saved data.  This is
          useful for interactive connections to see database changes
          made by other threads.

        - Errors encountered when trying to unpickle object state are
          now logged, if logging is enabled.

        - Added an extra checkpoint to ZODB 3 FileStorage Transaction
          commit to better handle system crashes.

        - ZPublisher request objects now have a BODYFILE key to get
          the request body as a file for non-form non-GET requests.

        - Cookie support was added to the ZServer FTP server to make
          FTP access compatible with cookie-based authentication.

        - ZServer now includes a NT Service, 'ZServer.py' This service
          requires the Python win32 extensions. It is not yet complete
          and not yet integrated with the Zope installer. It does however
          include a large doc string.
    
        - ZServer is offically using the z2.py start script now. The old
          start.py and zinit.py were removed. Note: z2.py will call zdaemon.py
          for you, if you want to use ZServer in daemon mode on Unix.
    
        - Added a 'has_permission' method to user objects. This facilitates
          finding out if a user has access to a given object. For example::
          
            <!--#if "AUTHENTICATED_USER.has_permissions('View',someObject)"-->
    
        - The product add list is now filtered. This should keep
          objects out of the product add list for which the user does
          not have adequite permissions. This is implemented with a
          new method, 'filtered_meta_types' which returns all the
          meta_types for which a given user has permissions. Note:
          Right now ZClasses do not associate permissions with
          Products. Thus all Control Panel Products appear in the
          product add list, no matter what roles the user has.
            
        - HTTP REQUEST objects now use HTML in their string representation.

        - The REQUEST keys of the form BASEx and URLx, where x is
          an integer now allow x to be greater than 9.
    
        - index_html is not longer used automatically for XML-RPC
          requests.

        - ZPublisher debugger, 'ZPublisher.test' now accepts a 'extra'
          keyword argument with a dictionary giving extra variables to
          be added to the request. This is handy for testing methods
          that require large amounts of input data, such as file uploads.

        - The load_site utility ('utilities/load_site.py') now accepts
          a '-9' switch to make it work with Zope (and Principia)
          sites at revisions 1.9 and lower. 

      Bugs fixed

        - Got rid of some DOS line-endings in xmlrpclib.py that caused
          install-time module compilation to fail.

        - Fixed DOS line-endings in medusa/max_sockets.py

        - Fixed a NameError (missing TupleType) definition in
          the export/import (copy/paste) machinery.

        - The startup script failed on Windows because it imported the
          posix module without checking the os.

        - ZServer crashed when the number of simultaneous connections
          exceeded a system limit, especially on Windows. ZServer now
          stops accepting new connections when the number of active
          connections exceeds a threshold.

        - Accessing cached results of items() (or values() or keys())
          calls on BTrees caused core dumps if affected elements were
          deleted.  For example::
    
                 for k in abtree.keys(): 
                    del abtree[k]

          Note that this code is still incorrect due to the fact that
          the objects returned from abtree.items()  (or values() or
          keys()) have reference, rather than copy semantics.
 
        - Compiling Acquisition.c caused (bogus) compiler errors on
          SGI.

        - zdeemun wus mispeled

        - Local roles were not handled correctly when filtering
          management views.

        - Copying and pasting ZClass instances copied and pasted their
          ZClasses too, effectively disconnecting them from their
          managed ZClasses. The same thing happened when ZClass
          instances were exported and imported.

        - The Database area in the control panel was broken.

        - Copy and paste of multiple objects was broken.

        - Copy and paste of ZClass methods was broken.

        - Copy and paste of ZClass properysheets was enabled and
          broken. It is now disabled.

        - Accidential import of BoboPOS in processes using ZODB (3)
          caused strange errors.

        - A bug in batch processing caused batch processing to hang or
          give incorrect results.

        - DocumentTemplate-based classes, like DTMLDocument and
          DTMLMethod could not be subclassed correctly. 

        - There was a memeory leak in the DTML try tag.

        - When adding folders with user databases, no check was made
          to make sure the user was permitted to add a user database.

        - Broken objects weren't created for objects whos class could
          not be found when using ZODB 3.

        - The 'self' argument wasn't properly passed to external
          methods used in ZClasses.

        - The Setup file in the SearchIndex package had an uneeded -I
          option that caused compilation errors on some platforms.

        - ZGadflyDA transactions were not committed.

        - ZClasses didn't provide an interface to edit their titles.

        - Propertysheets were broken for ZClasses that inherited from
          built-in classes, like Folder and DTMLDocument.

        - Propertysheets were disabled for instances by default.  Now,
          propertysheets have the "manage properties" permission by
          default.

        - The navigation pane wasn't updated when classes were added.

        - Changes in ZClasses were not properly propigated to all
          database connections using ZODB3.

        - Databse connections were not closed correctly under heavy
          load when the number of application threads exceeded the
          number of database connections in the connection pool. This
          lead to Zope locking up under load if the application thread
          count was increased using the z2.py -t option.

        - undo in ZODB 3 didn't properly refresh objects.
 
        - export and import was broken for ZODB 3.
          
        - Fixed ZServer HTTP zombie killing. Now hung connections are
          successfully closed.

        - A bug in handling the case when a file was created on open
          without the create flag caused weird errors on windows.

        - The REQUEST BASE1 key was not computed correctly when
          SCRIPT_NAME was an empty string.

        - It was impossible to return an empty list or dictionary to
          an XML-RPC request. 
 
        - The database conversion script failes when the first record
          in the input file lacked peoperly-formatted transaction
          data.  The conversion script also didn't work on some
          systems due to an incorrect 'flush' call on the *input*
          file. 

        - Factories that were also ZClass methods didn't get
          unregistered properly when they were deleted.

    Zope 2.0 alpha 3

      Features added

        - XML-RPC support

          All Zope objects are now XML-RPC servers.

        - ZODB 2 (aka BoboPOS) to ZODB 3 FileStorage database conversion

          An option has been added to the bbb.py script in the
          utilities directory to convert ZODB 2 database files to ZODB
          3 format. The bbb.py script now accepts an '-f' option that
          takes an argument specifying an output file name.  For
          example, to convert the ZODB 2 data file, Data.bbb, in the
          var directory, to ZODB 3 FileStorage format::

            python utilities/bbb.py -f var/Data.fs var/Data.bbb

          Note that version data are not converted.

        - In Z Classes, Methods and Property Sheets now have a "Define
          Permissions" management tab to map permissions. This tab used
          to be labeled "Security".

        - ZServer's FTP server now attempts to display an object's owner
          as defined in local roles.  

      Bugs fixed

        - The cache management screens were broken

        - Local roles on DTML Methods and Documents were not persistent.

        - ZServer's select trigger has been updated and now shouldn't give
          errors when running ZServer as another users.   

        - The tree tag used persistent object ids in ways that were 
          not compatible with ZODB 3.  This caused strange behavior
          like weird cntent-types and invalid state messages.

        - The DTML In tag no longer handled batch processing correctly, 
          and sometimes got into infinite loops.  This was due to a very
          old bug that was made effective by Python 1.5.2.

        - Objects that could not be loaded because their implementing modules
          (or packages) had been removed were not handled properly as
          broken objects when ZODB 3 was used.

        - The DTML Python string format did not allow expressions for 
          simple variable insertion.  Expression insertion is now
          allowed if the var tag name if the var tag name is supplied,
          as in::

            %(var expr="x+1")s

          Note that, because of this change, the var tag name must
          also be supplied when a variable named 'var' is inserted, as
          in::

            %(var var)s

    Zope 2.0 alpha 2

      Features added

        - There is a new optional EXPERIMENTAL HTML DTML syntax.  As
          an alternative to SSI syntax, you can now use ordinary HTML
          syntax, as in:

            <dtml-in objectIds>
              <dtml-var sequence-item>
            </dtml-in>

          You can also use an entity-reference syntax for the var tag
          as an alternative to the tag syntax.  For example::

            &dtml-foo;

          is equivalent to::

            <dtml-var foo>

          and is especially handy in attributes::

            <a href="&dtml-foo;">

          Both the new syntax and the SSI syntax are allowed in the
          same document.  In fact, if you were really twisted, you
          could:

            <dtml-in objectIds>
              <dtml-var sequence-item>
            <!--#/in-->

          IMPORTANT

             This feature really is EXPERIMENTAL.  It could disappear
            someday, depending on how people like it.  We'd really like
            to get feedback on how useful this feature is.

        - reverse options were added to the in and tree tags.

        - The startup script, z2.py, has a -D option to turn on
          debugging mode.

        - Made enivorment variable settings work with the http
          server. So now you can do things like ./z2.py -w 8888
          SCRIPT_NAME=Zope and actually have the specified SCRIPT_NAME
          override the normal SCRIPT_NAME. This is Useful for using ZServer
          behind a proxy.

        - Added support for the Medusa monitor server.

        - There's a first cut at a ZServer NT service. This is Zope on
          NT's answer to zdeamon.py

          It actually seems to work, though there's still a fair
          amount missing.

        - The error messages for missing or miss-formatted access
          files was improved.

        - A new debugging method, manage_debug, has been added to
          Control_Panel to monitor the Zope process for possible
          memory leaks.

        - The name, 'this', has been added to the namespace available
          to construction methods to provide a function for computing
          the destination object.  The name, 'this' is essentially
          equivalent to 'Destination' and 'Destination' will be
          depricated eventially.

        - The title of the main Zope management interface now includes
          a full URL.

        - Folders that have (or acquire) index_html methods now have
          view tabs for viewing index_html.

        - On browsers that support Java Script, the "Add" button is
          ommitted and the add form is visited as soon as a selection
          is made from the select list.

        - The python-pickle format used to export data from ZODB 2 was
          updated to handle string data differently.

      Bugs fixed

        - A number of bugs and features were left out of the 
          release notes for Zope 2.0 alpha 1.  The notes for
          Zope 2.0 alpha 1 have been updated substantially.

        - There was a serious memory leak introduced when a security
          bug was fixed in 1.10.0.

        - There was a memory leak in ZODB 3 persistent objects, which
          now manage object IDs as persistent objects.

        - The Python 1.5.2 cgi module didn't work with Zope.  
          Zope now includes its own fixed version of the module.

          This bug caused FTP, Netscape Publishing and WebDAV to fail.

        - A bug in transaction management caused Gadfly requests to
          fail. Other database adapters need to be updated.

        - Running ZServer as nobody failed due to the order in which
          the log file was opened.
          
        - Added fix contributed by Brian Hooper for HTTP Clients which
          don't always spell their HTTP headers correctly.

        - A number of classes didn't get there reference-counts
          reduced when instances were destroyed.  This confused the
          new memory allocation monitoring tool.

        - New user folders had no effect because they did not get
          properly registered in their containing folders.

        - Changes made to factory objects were lost when a process was
          restarted. 
          
        - Clicking on the 'Help' caused the help information to be
          displayed in the current frame, rather than in a new
          window. 

        - Shutting down Zope attempted to save the database index even
          when Zope was run in read-only mode.

        - A number of fixes were made in the Date-Time support.

        - Batch processing in the in tag sometimes failed.

        - Sites with custom roles in the top-level application
          object did not pick up the new 'Owner' role.
          
        - Content-type detection had problems in DTML documents and
          methods. 

        - Some cookie expiration dates used 2-digit years.

        - Error values for errors raised by ExternalMethods were lost.

        - Values returned bu absolute_url were not URL quoted.

        - Extra newlines were prepended to documents when they were
          edited.

        - Objects ids were not properly quoted in a number of places,
          because id quoting was unnecessary until recent relaxation
          of the rules for ids.
          
        - ExternalMethods are now automatically reloaded when running
          in debug mode.

        - Search interfaces generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer include a "Cancel" button.

        - Errors were masked by a bug in handling ZODB3 transaction
          aborts. 

        - The ZODB 3 cache manager deactivated objects too quickly,
          causing performance to degrade.

        - BASEx request variables were not computed correctly when
          SCRIPT_NAME was not empty.

        - The URLx variables couldn't be computed in some cases when
          using ZServer.


    Zope 2.0 alpha 1

      BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY

        - A change was made to the way ZClasses are constructed.

          Previously, the __call__ method was an alias for the
          index_html method which took took an id and a request
          and created a new instance and added the instance to
          the destination.
          
          Now, the __call__ method simply calls the underlying
          managed class with the supplied arguments to create and
          return an instance.  The instance is not added to a
          folder.
          
          The index_html method is now an alias for the
          createInObjectManager method, which does what the
          index_html method did before.
          
          There is a new method, fromRequest, that takes an id
          and a request and creates a new instance.  It does not
          at the instance to a destination.

      Features Added

        - Integration of ZODB 3

        - The ZClass construction interface has been cleaned up to
          make construction of ZClasses a little easier from Python.

        - When adding ZClasses, there is now an option to
          automatically create construction methods and a factory.

        - "Management" screens now *only* show tabs a user permitted
          to see.  Used in combination with carefully selected roles, 
          this change provides an adaptable management interface.

        - Instance homes can now have local Products directories.

        - There is a new ZServer start up script that can be used without
          modification and that integrates process management.  This
          script replaces the ZServer 'start.py' and 'zinit.py' scripts.

        - When the new startup script is used, then the control panel
          shows a "Restart" button which causes the Zope process to
          exit and be restarted and a "Shutdown" button that causes Zope 
          to exit and not be restarted.

        - There is a *very* rough cut at a centralized version manager
          in the control panel.  This is only functional when the
          ZODB3 database is used.  This feature will mature
          significantly before the final 2.0 release.
   
        - A new Zope icon was added, and the "powered by Zope" icon
          has been updated.

        - Made DTMLDocuments, DTMLMethods, Images, Files and Folders
          subclassable by ZClasses.

        - ZClass property sheets can now have read and modify
          permissions.

        - An "add list" name can be specified when creating a ZClass.
          If specified, then construction methods and a factory are
          created. This makes the class immediately instantiatable and
          provides construction method examples.

        - The ZClass basic property sheet now shows base classes.

        - Changed the string representation of HTTPRequest so that
          <!--#var REQUEST--> is a lot friendlier.
 
        - Added a Zope debugging short cut.  

          Now::

            import ZPublisher
            ZPublisher.Zope(path)

          is a shortcut for::

            import ZPublisher
            ZPublisher.test('Zope', path)

      Bugs Fixed

        - ZClass permission setting interfaces didn't show inherited
          permissions.

        - A number of bugs arising from attempts to set 
          caching headers were fixed.

        - Some default permissions were not set correctly.

        - The unused non-functioning resource-consuming Scheduler has
          been removed.

        - Access was given to objects without roles even if access
          would be denied to the container.

        - Fix submitted by Martijn Pieters:

          Any property type int or long, set to 0, showed up in the
          Properties Management tab as blank. This resulted in errors
          when trying to change values of other properties, etc.

        - Version names were computed incorrectly.

        - Delete and rename were broken for ZClasses.

        - It wasn't possible to override inherited attributes with
          methods in ZClasses.

        - Property values were not removed from ZClasses when property
          sheets were deleted.  This made it impossible to re-add a
          property from a deleted property sheet.

        - Generated property view and edit forms for ZClass property
          sheets had a number of problems.

        - The propertysheets property sheet should only allow addition of
          property sheets.

    Zope 1.11.0 pr1, which should have been named Zope 2.0.0 alpha 0.
      
      Lots has changed in this release. The major news is ZClasses and WebDAV.
      
      Features Added

        - Added WebDAV support. See http://webdav.zope.org/ for details.

        - Added Z Classes. Documentation is forthcoming.

          ZClasses might be viewed as somewhat experimental, although
          we're using them aggressively for internal projects.

        - Added Property Sheets. Documentation is forthcoming.
        
        - ZServer now included in distribution.
        
        - Added new product registration interface. Documentation is
          forthcoming.

        - Added local roles which allow for permission settings for
          users on individual objects. This allows for 'ownership' of Zope
          objects. Added 'Owner' role to default roles, and automatic
          setting of the 'Owner' role on a created object to the user who
          created it.
        
        - Added hooks for XML-RPC support to ZPublisher. See the source
          for details. XML-RPC support is not yet finished.
        
        - Added automatic height/width detection for JPEG images.

        - Revised Zope error messages.

        - A new DTML 'try' tag added based on work by Jordan B. Baker.
          See the source for details. Documentation is forthcoming.

        - A new DTML 'mime' tag has been added. See the MIMETools README.txt
          for more information.

        - A new 'range' function added the the '_' DTML variable. 

        - A new 'utilities' directory is included in the distribution.

        - A new flag attribute, 'only', of the DTML 'with' tag
          prunes the DTML namespace to only the namespace created
          with the with tag.

        - Added contributed support for encoding options in the SendMail
          tag and MailHost send method.
          
        - Mangement tabs are now prettier and allow status messages with
          the manage_tabs_message variable.
          
        - Added a method of notifying users of changes without using a
          MessageDialog. This makes editing DTML Documents and Methods
          easier.
          
        - Added more documentation to Product add screens.

        - New icons for many Zope objects.

        - Sessions are now known as Versions.

        - Changed from using 'manage_main' as default management method to use
          'manage_workspace' which is a reserved method that dispatches to the
          default management interface which is the first interface defined
          in manage_options

        - Permission settings are now inherited by Products from their base
          classes. This means when you build a Product you only need to specify
          its particular permission settings.

        - Changed ZPublisher.publish_module's interface so that instead of
          providing a stdin, stdout, and stderr, you can provide a Request and
          a Response object. ZServer makes extensive use of this feature.

        - Added methods to HTTPRequest to allow access to ZPublishers object
          traversal. HTTPRequest.clone and HTTPRequest.resolve_url. See the
          source for more details.
          
        - Added a new "builtin" function reorder to DTML.
        
          reorder(s, [with, without]])
 
          Reorder the items in s according to the order given in with
          and with items mentioned in without removed.  Items from s
          not mentioned in with are removed.

          s, with, and without are all either sequences if strings
          or sequences of key-value tuples, with ordering done on the
          keys.

          This function is useful for constructing ordered select lists.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added small fixes to ZopeHTTPServer in anticipation of DAV.

        - Construction, upload, and edit methods did not consistently
          support either string or file data.  This caused really weird
          behavior when file upload was used with out includeing the 
          ':string' suffix in the argument name when doing a file upload.

          This bug was previously (and incorrectly) reported as a 
          ZPublisher.Client problem.

        - Errors in ExternalMethods were masked by bugs in error
          reporting logic.  The bugs were made far more effective
          by Python 1.5.1.

        - Databases (or export files) created in binary distributions
          were not usable in source distributions due to cPickle
          limitations in stock Python 1.5.1.  We now link/copy the
          cPickle extension to BoboPOS to make sure that it uses the
          latest version.

        - Fixed registration of MailHost settings and incorrect default
          quoted-printable encoding of message bodies.

        - Added contributed patch that fixes bug in copied-object id
          generation.

        - DTML Documents and Methods now attempt to determine their
          content-type rather than assuming they are text/html.

        - Fixed PUT bug in determining content-type of binary files.

        - Added changes that allow the top level userfolder to be replaced by a
          UserDB or other userfolder-like object.

        - Fixed an FTP support bug that sometimes kept simple items from
          producting FTP listings.

        - Added URL1 instead of "." as the form target for the workspace forms --
          using "." causes NS servers to intercept the request and report an
          error, making Zope effectively unusable.

        - Added ZPL 1.0 and credits to copyright link in management screen.
          
        - Fixed a bug that prevented validate() from working if the top-level
          object were accessed and no default object (index_html) existed.

        - Fixed a logic bug in security validation that allowed access to
          unacquired objects that didn't have __roles__ even if the
          containing object was protected.

    Zope  1.10.2

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a permission problem with DTMLMethod objects that caused
          errors when attempting to commit permission changes.

        - Factories could not determine the available methods
          when they were being edited, making them uneditable.

    Zope  1.10.1

      This is a Python 1.5.2 beta 2 compatability release.

      A Python C API change in Python 1.5.2 beta 2 broke
      Zope.  This release contains a fix.

      Zope should work correctly with Python 1.5, 1.5.1 and
      beta versions of 1.5.2.

    Zope  1.10.0

      New Features

        - Added Import/Export interfaces to Folders.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a bug in ZopeHTTPServer which caused it to fail on POST
          requests without content-type headers.

        - PUT and file uploads would fail if the content-type could
          not be determined. Now objects created via PUT and file
          upload will default to either 'application/octet-stream'
          for binary files or 'text/plain' for non-binary files if
          no content-type can be determined from headers or filename
          extensions.

        - Fixed a permission bug left from a change to the Find support.

        - Fixed misc typos in docstrings and docs.

        - Fixed a bug that kept objects from being freed from the cache!
          Basically, there was never a check for inactive objects.

        - MailHost objects didn't do appropriate CRLF conversion or
          recognize 4xx server responses.

    Zope  1.10.0 pr1

      New Features

        - Documents generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer use tab characters.

        - Added a -s option to ZopeHTTPServer.  This is useful
          for emulating older sites when generating screen shots
          for creating or updating documentation.

        - Default bobobase now includes a Zope button along with a link
          to the Zope site. This satisfies the ZPL attribution requirement.
          The button is created by a new builtin method
          'ZopeAttributionButton'. Also, both the source and the binary
          distributions now have the same default bobobase.

        - Made the logic for getting SOFTWARE_HOME a bit more robust, so that 
          it handles relative paths and paths starting with '.' and '..'.
          This is useful when simply importing Main from the Python
          prompt in the lib/python directory.

        - The ThreadLock module has been changed to reflect changes
          in the Python API in Python 1.5.2.

        - The '_' variable in DTML now has the random module
          as an attribute and DateTime.DateTime as the attribute DateTime.

        - Added keys() and items() methods to the REQUEST object.

        - Added get_header() method to the REQUEST object for retrieving
          HTTP headers.

        - New SearchIndex package and BTree component have been added to 
          the distribution, providing low-level support for products with
          built-in searching such as Tabula and Confera.

        - Documents have now been split into two distinct object types:
          DTML Documents and DTML Methods. DTML Methods behave exactly
          as Document objects did. DTML Documents are similar except that
          the "client" or "self" of a DTML Document is the DTML Document
          itself rather than its parent, and DTML Documents can have
          properties.

        - DTML Documents, Image and File objects can now have properties.

        - A new PropertyManager mixin class allows developers to easily
          add properties and property management to non-Folder objects.

        - Added a new absolute_url method which can generate an absolute
          url for the object on which the method is called.

        - GIF and PNG Images now figure out their own dimensions when
          uploaded. Image height and width properties are now editable.

        - Images now generate themselves as html IMG tags, using an absolute
          url and correct height and width tags if possible.

        - There is a new form input type, boolean, for inputing boolean
          data.

        - Added a read_only option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors to open a database in read_only
          mode.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_READ_ONLY, used by the
          Zope framework.  If this variable is set, then the database
          is opened in read only mode.  If this variable is set to a
          string parsable by DateTime.DateTime, then the database is
          opened read-only as of the time given.  Note that changes
          made by another process after the database has been opened
          are not visible.

        - Added a database_quota option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors and a
          SimpleDB.MultipleRevision.set_quota method to set a database
          quota. The quota is given as either an integer number of
          bytes, or a function taking an integer number of bytes
          argument and returning whether the quota has been exceeded.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_DATABASE_QUOTA, used by the
          Zope framework. If this variable is set, it should be set to
          an integer number of bytes.  Additions to the database are
          not allowed if the database size exceeds the quota.          

        - Added size and last modification time to DTML Method and DTML
          Document edit interface.

        - Added a new module, BoboPOS.winlock, that provides file
          locking on windows.  This should prevent many cases of data
          corruption. 

        - Added FTP support to Documents, Files, Images, and Folders.
          FTP interface is detailed in OFS/FTPInterface.py though it may
          change. Basic FTP support was also added to SimpleItem to make
          it easier for Zope objects to support FTP.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Permissions for manage_clone method were wrong, meaning that
          essentially only managers could use it.

        - File paths that showed up in tracebacks reflected the paths the 
          files had when they were compiled (at distribution build-time).
          The compiled-in paths have been changed to be relative to the
          Zope installation directory.

        - Fixed a bug in ZPublisher's special handling the "cancel"
          submit buttons. The test for the cancel button was case
          sensitive.  I changed it so it would accept any case, as
          well as extra spaces.

          Cancel buttons should probably be handled using the new
          :method form type, but this would require the presense of an
          appropriate redirect method.  Perhaps there should be
          a :redirect form type.

        - Date strings with years < 31 were not accepted, even
          through the documentation says they should be.

        - If Zope crashed or was unable to completely write a database
          record, then on restart, a data corruption error was reported.
          Now, truncated records are removed if necessary on start up.
          If necessary, other records are removed as well to avoid 
          partially-written transactions.

        - Lack of sys.argv in the win32 service version of Zope caused 
          it to raise errors under certain conditions.

        - Several HTTP PUT related bugs were fixed.

        - Simple items did not have an objectValues method, which caused
          odd behavior in certain tree tags since the method would be
          acquired from the parent of the simple item.

        - The Find form in the management interface depended on javascript
          to function properly.

        - Added a fix to compensate for the fact that Apache servers may 
          rename the entire cgi environment when mod_rewrite rules are 
          used in .htaccess files.

        - If system clocks were changed, so that database records 
          had records in the "future", then database corruption could
          either occur or be incorrectly reported.  Now this situation
          results in an informative error message and corruption does
          not occur.

    Zope 1.9.0

      New Features

        - Zope now provides better information about products.  If a 
          Product has a README.txt, then it will be readable through
          the product management interface.   

          If a product encounters an error during startup, the
          traceback is available through the product management
          interface.

        - Cache statistics are displayed in minutes, rather than
          seconds.

        - Products can define the attribute '__module_aliases__' in
          their '__init__' modules that specifies aliases for modules
          used in the product.  This is useful if module names have
          changed and the database contains pickles refering to the
          old modules.  The attribute should be a sequence of
          tuples. Each tuple has a (dotted) module name and a module.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Development on ZopeHTTPServer has been frozen in anticipation
          of the switch to Medusa. Therefor ZopeHTTPServer still does
          support PUT. Sorry.

        - ZPublisher.Client used the obsolete rand module.

        - Errors occuring during product import caused Zope to fail to come
          up.

        - Product version information was not displayed correctly.

        - ZGadflyDA cached table meta-data which lead to missleading
          information when browsing databases.

    Zope 1.9 beta 3

      New Features

        - Z SQL Methods (FKA Aqueduct) and the Z Gadfly Database Adapter
          are now included.

        - The argument handling for ZopeHTTPServer has been changed to 
          be a bit more flexible wrt the order of argumements.  
          While options must still come first, environment settings
          can be given in any order.  This makes startup scripts loke
          serve.py quite a bit simpler.

        - ZopeHTTPServer now sports preliminary support for PUT publishing.
          
        - ZopeHTTPServer now serves from port 9673 by default, not 8080.

      Bugs fixed

        - The start.bat file used to start ZopeHTTPServer on win32 was
          misnamed and didn't correctly pass command-line arguments.

        - Win32 machines without an existing Python installation had problems
          due to PYTHONPATH bootstrapping.

        - The included ZopeHTTPServer was failing to start correctly on
          win32 machines that were not connected to the network.

    Zope 1.9 beta 2

      In addition to various documentation updates, this release includes:

      New Features

        - Changed serve.py to accept ZopeHTTPServer command-line options.

        - Added a -P option to the ZopeHTTPServer to specify a file
          to contain the process ID.  This allows a script to stop
          the process on Unix.

        - Added support for the environment variables, Z_REALM and
          Z_DEBUG_MODE to set an authentication realm and to
          enable debug mode.

      Bugs fixed

        - External methods were broken due to differences in 
          Python 1.4 and Python 1.5 comparison semantics.

        - ZopeHTTPServer command-line environment settings
          were not available in os.environ.

        - Some class references were wrong in examples in the ExtensionClass
          documentation.

        - INSTANCE_HOME was not set correctly when the debugger was run
          with a relative path to the published module.

        - The #! line in the ZopeHTTPServer was hidden by the copyright
          statement and didn't have the right path.

        - A bug in pcgi_publisher.py caused file uploads larger than 1 MB
          to fail.

    Zope 1.9 beta 1

      Bugs fixed:

        - pcgi did not build correctly on Solaris 2.6

        - links in headers were broken when Zope was reached with
          /, as is the case when the ZopeHTTPServer is used.

        - Python sources used tabs and spaces for indentation, which
          made some people unhappy.

        - Copyright statements were missing or out of date.
        
        - Added better instructions for building and running Zope.

        - Added new Zope License and attribution information.

        - Merged BoboHTTPServer updates with ZopeHTTPServer. Including 
          socket changes to allow easier stopping and starting.

        - Shutting down the ZopeHTTPServer from the application
          caused an empty document to be returned.

        - The install scripts failed if run more than once when attempting
          to create a var directory.

      Features

        - Added (and old version of) the zlib module to make
          installation simpler.

        - Zope requires an access file.  The install scripts now create
          one.

    Zope 1.9 alpha 1 

      This was the inital Zope test release.

  Futures

    Things we plan to happen real soon (maybe next release)

      Features

       - include a serve shell script along the lines of:
   
           #!/bin/sh
           python serve.py > var/serve.log 2> var/serve.errors &
   
         Note that this script should be written by the installers
         and use sys.executable.

         (Brian)

      Bugs

       - Chase down weird bugs reported by Michel Pelletier.

    Things to do sometime

      Features

        - Better deamon management for ZopeHTTPServer, Medusa,
          and pcgi-LRP (when pcgi wrapper gets out of process
          management business).

          (Note that there is some experimental code along these
           lines in principia main.)

       - Need make_clean.py that:
   
         - runs make clobber for the extensions
   
         - runs make clean in pcgi
   
         - prints an message reminding user to manually remove var
   
         (brian)

       - The default access file should be handled a little differently.
         The installer should make people enter values, the default
         should have a randomly generated password, or the default should
         be ommitted.
