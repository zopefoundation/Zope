Zope Changes

  This file gives information on changes made to Zope over time,
  things that need to be done before the next release and future
  plans.

  Notes on Zope 2.0

    ZOPE 2.0 REQUIRES PYTHON 1.5.2!

    Zope 2.0 will the next stable Zope release.  We will 
    no longer make Zope 1.11 changes.  Zope 1.11 included some very
    significant changes that were too big to lead to a stable release
    before Zope 2.0 becomes stable, so these changes have, essentially
    been moved to Zope 2.0.  

    So, Zope 2 includes:

      - ZODB 3, the next generation of the Zope Object Database,

      - Z Classes, a new mechanism for building Zope applications

      - WebDAV support,

      - ZServer, the integration of Zope and Medusa,

      - Many other sundry big significant items:

        o Look and feel improvements,

        o Tighter security,

        o Simpler creation of Python products.

    ZODB 3

      ZODB is the next generation of our object database architecture.
      It provides a number of advantages over or existing databases:

      - Support for concurrency,

      - Well-defined storage management interface that will allow many
        different storage management strategies to be used, from file
        storage, to RDBMS storage, to memory storage,

      - More robust file storage format,

      - Much better version support and integrations of 
        versions with the transaction system.  For example,
        it is possible to commit from one version to another, 
        to undo version commit and abort, and to use "temporary
        versions" to reduce memory use when manipulating large
        quantities of data.

      - Support for multiple databases in the same object system. 

      - Support for multi-process storage managers, although the
        standard distribution will not include any multiple process
        storage managers.

      Note: Using ZODB 3 from Python

        In ZODB 2, you could access the top-level application object
        with::

	  import Main
	  app=Main.app

	You could then navigate from the top-level object by getting
	attributes, calling methods, etc..

	In ZODB 3, you get the top-level object like this::

	  import Zope
	  app=Zope.app()

	  ... do stuff with objects

	  # and when you're done:
	  app._p_jar.close()

	You have to import the Zope application module, which uses
	ZODB 2 rather than ZODB 2.  In ZODB 3, you have to get a
	connection to a database before you access an object.  The
	'app()' function combines opening a connection and getting the
	top level object.  When your done using the top-level object
	(or any objects accessible from it) you can close the database
	connection by calling the 'close' method on the '_p_jar'
	attribute, which is the database connection.  You don't need
	to close the connection if you are going to exit Python
	without doing any more work.

	Don't forget to::

	  get_transaction().commit()

	If you want any changes to made to be saved.

      Note: Converting ZODB 2 (aka BoboPOS) data files to ZODB 3.

        The bbb.py script in utilities can be used to convert data
        files from ZODB 2 to ZODB 3 format::

	  utilities/bbb.py -f output_file input_file

        Here's a example::

           utilities/bbb.py -f var/Data.fs var/Data.bbb

      ZODB 3 To-do

        There are still a number of things to get working:

        - Multiple database support isn't done yet,

	- OPTIMIZATION: FileStorage will get a more efficient data
          structure for maintaining index information and key methods
          in the ZODB framework will move to C.

        - Zope needs to be updated to be thread-safe.  This is not as
          hard as it sounds, since persistent objects are always
          thread-safe. (Well, only one thread accesses any particular
          copy of a persistent object.)  The biggest issue here is
          mutable global variables, mutable objects stored in classes, 
	  mutable default Python function arguments, and global
          variables in extensions.

        - Most database adapters are likely to be problematic unless
          the underlying extensions and libraries:

            - allow multiple simultaneous database connections,

            - are thread safe,

            - give up the Python global interpreter lock when
	      making database calls.

          This is only a problem when running Zope 2 with multiple
	  threads.

    ZClasses

      ZClasses provide a powerful new way to develop Zope
      applications.  ZClasses allow new objects to be developed
      entirely through the web.  

      ZClasses also support building applications through combinations
      of Python classes created on the file system and objects created
      through the web.  For example, Python classes could implemented
      business/domain logic and then augmented with Zope web methods
      to provide a web interface.

    Zope 2.0 Road-map

      In short
 
        We expect and expect to provide a stable Zope 2.0 release in
        early August.

      Zope 2.0 releases

        We expend to make a number of Zope 2.0 alpha, beta, or
        candidate releases over the next several weeks.

        Early releases will support both the ZODB 2 (aka BoboPOS) and
        ZODB 3.  We may even support ZODB 2 in Zope 2.0 betas, but
        ZODB 2 support will be phased out by the final Zope 2.0
        release.  Some features (e.g. the new control panel version
        manager) will require ZODB 3.

  Releases

    Zope 2.0 alpha 4

      Features added

        - The let and return tags were added to DTML.

	- The startup script, z2.py, has additional documentation on
	  providing empty strings as arguments.

        - Added a -P option to the startup script, z2.py, to specify a
          base port for the various servers. For example::

            python z2.py -P8000 

          is equivalent to:

            python z2.py -w8080 -f8021 -m8099

          This is a convenient short-hand for systes with many zserver
          instances running.

        - Added an -l option to the startup script, z2.py, to specify
          the location of the ZServer hit log.

        - A progress indicator was added to the database conversion
          utility, utilities/bbb.py.

	- Cookie support was added to the ZServer FTP server to make
          FTP access more compatible with cookie-based authentication.

      Bugs fixed

        - Got rid of some DOS line-endings in xmlrpclib.py that caused
          install-time module compilation to fail.

        - Fixed a NameError (missing TupleType) definition in
          the export/import (copy/paste) machinery.

        - The startup script failed on Windows because it imported the
          posix module without checking the os.

        - ZServer crashed when the number of simultaneous connections
          exceeded a system limit, especially on Windows. ZServer now
          stops accepting new connections when the number of active
          connections exceeds a threshold.

    Zope 2.0 alpha 3

      Features added

        - XML-RPC support

          All Zope objects are now XML-RPC servers.

        - ZODB 2 (aka BoboPOS) to ZODB 3 FileStorage database conversion

          An option has been added to the bbb.py script in the
	  utilities directory to convert ZODB 2 database files to ZODB
	  3 format. The bbb.py script now accepts an '-f' option that
	  takes an argument specifying an output file name.  For
	  example, to convert the ZODB 2 data file, Data.bbb, in the
	  var directory, to ZODB 3 FileStorage format::

            python utilities/bbb.py -f var/Data.fs var/Data.bbb

          Note that version data are not converted.

        - In Z Classes, Methods and Property Sheets now have a "Define
          Permissions" management tab to map permissions. This tab used
          to be labeled "Security".

        - ZServer's FTP server now attempts to display an object's owner
          as defined in local roles.  

      Bugs fixed

        - The cache management screens were broken

        - Local roles on DTML Methods and Documents were not persistent.

        - ZServer's select trigger has been updated and now shouldn't give
          errors when running ZServer as another users.   

        - The tree tag used persistent object ids in ways that were 
          not compatible with ZODB 3.  This caused strange behavior
          like weird cntent-types and invalid state messages.

        - The DTML In tag no longer handled batch processing correctly, 
          and sometimes got into infinite loops.  This was due to a very
          old bug that was made effective by Python 1.5.2.

        - Objects that could not be loaded because their implementing modules
          (or packages) had been removed were not handled properly as
          broken objects when ZODB 3 was used.

	- The DTML Python string format did not allow expressions for 
	  simple variable insertion.  Expression insertion is now
	  allowed if the var tag name if the var tag name is supplied,
	  as in::

	    %(var expr="x+1")s

	  Note that, because of this change, the var tag name must
	  also be supplied when a variable named 'var' is inserted, as
	  in::

	    %(var var)s

    Zope 2.0 alpha 2

      Features added

        - There is a new optional EXPERIMENTAL HTML DTML syntax.  As
	  an alternative to SSI syntax, you can now use ordinary HTML
	  syntax, as in:

	    <dtml-in objectIds>
	      <dtml-var sequence-item>
	    </dtml-in>

	  You can also use an entity-reference syntax for the var tag
	  as an alternative to the tag syntax.  For example::

	    &dtml-foo;

          is equivalent to::

	    <dtml-var foo>

	  and is especially handy in attributes::

	    <a href="&dtml-foo;">

	  Both the new syntax and the SSI syntax are allowed in the
	  same document.  In fact, if you were really twisted, you
	  could:

	    <dtml-in objectIds>
	      <dtml-var sequence-item>
	    <!--#/in-->

	  IMPORTANT

 	    This feature really is EXPERIMENTAL.  It could disappear
	    someday, depending on how people like it.  We'd really like
	    to get feedback on how useful this feature is.

	- reverse options were added to the in and tree tags.

        - The startup script, z2.py, has a -D option to turn on
          debugging mode.

        - Made enivorment variable settings work with the http
          server. So now you can do things like ./z2.py -w 8888
          SCRIPT_NAME=Zope and actually have the specified SCRIPT_NAME
          override the normal SCRIPT_NAME. This is Useful for using ZServer
          behind a proxy.

	- Added support for the Medusa monitor server.

	- There's a first cut at a ZServer NT service. This is Zope on
          NT's answer to zdeamon.py

	  It actually seems to work, though there's still a fair
	  amount missing.

	- The error messages for missing or miss-formatted access
          files was improved.

        - A new debugging method, manage_debug, has been added to
          Control_Panel to monitor the Zope process for possible
          memory leaks.

	- The name, 'this', has been added to the namespace available
          to construction methods to provide a function for computing
          the destination object.  The name, 'this' is essentially
          equivalent to 'Destination' and 'Destination' will be
          depricated eventially.

	- The title of the main Zope management interface now includes
          a full URL.

	- Folders that have (or acquire) index_html methods now have
          view tabs for viewing index_html.

	- On browsers that support Java Script, the "Add" button is
          ommitted and the add form is visited as soon as a selection
          is made from the select list.

	- The python-pickle format used to export data from ZODB 2 was
          updated to handle string data differently.

      Bugs fixed

        - A number of bugs and features were left out of the 
          release notes for Zope 2.0 alpha 1.  The notes for
          Zope 2.0 alpha 1 have been updated substantially.

	- There was a serious memory leak introduced when a security
          bug was fixed in 1.10.0.

	- There was a memory leak in ZODB 3 persistent objects, which
          now manage object IDs as persistent objects.

	- The Python 1.5.2 cgi module didn't work with Zope.  
	  Zope now includes its own fixed version of the module.

	  This bug caused FTP, Netscape Publishing and WebDAV to fail.

	- A bug in transaction management caused Gadfly requests to
          fail. Other database adapters need to be updated.

	- Running ZServer as nobody failed due to the order in which
	  the log file was opened.
	  
	- Added fix contributed by Brian Hooper for HTTP Clients which
          don't always spell their HTTP headers correctly.

	- A number of classes didn't get there reference-counts
          reduced when instances were destroyed.  This confused the
          new memory allocation monitoring tool.

	- New user folders had no effect because they did not get
          properly registered in their containing folders.

	- Changes made to factory objects were lost when a process was
          restarted. 
	  
	- Clicking on the 'Help' caused the help information to be
          displayed in the current frame, rather than in a new
          window. 

	- Shutting down Zope attempted to save the database index even
          when Zope was run in read-only mode.

	- A number of fixes were made in the Date-Time support.

	- Batch processing in the in tag sometimes failed.

        - Sites with custom roles in the top-level application
	  object did not pick up the new 'Owner' role.
	  
	- Content-type detection had problems in DTML documents and
          methods. 

	- Some cookie expiration dates used 2-digit years.

	- Error values for errors raised by ExternalMethods were lost.

	- Values returned bu absolute_url were not URL quoted.

	- Extra newlines were prepended to documents when they were
          edited.

        - Objects ids were not properly quoted in a number of places,
          because id quoting was unnecessary until recent relaxation
          of the rules for ids.
	  
	- ExternalMethods are now automatically reloaded when running
          in debug mode.

	- Search interfaces generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer include a "Cancel" button.

        - Errors were masked by a bug in handling ZODB3 transaction
          aborts. 

	- The ZODB 3 cache manager deactivated objects too quickly,
          causing performance to degrade.

	- BASEx request variables were not computed correctly when
          SCRIPT_NAME was not empty.

        - The URLx variables couldn't be computed in some cases when
          using ZServer.


    Zope 2.0 alpha 1

      BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY

        - A change was made to the way ZClasses are constructed.

	  Previously, the __call__ method was an alias for the
	  index_html method which took took an id and a request
	  and created a new instance and added the instance to
	  the destination.
	  
	  Now, the __call__ method simply calls the underlying
	  managed class with the supplied arguments to create and
	  return an instance.  The instance is not added to a
	  folder.
	  
	  The index_html method is now an alias for the
	  createInObjectManager method, which does what the
	  index_html method did before.
	  
	  There is a new method, fromRequest, that takes an id
	  and a request and creates a new instance.  It does not
	  at the instance to a destination.

      Features Added

        - Integration of ZODB 3

        - The ZClass construction interface has been cleaned up to
          make construction of ZClasses a little easier from Python.

        - When adding ZClasses, there is now an option to
          automatically create construction methods and a factory.

        - "Management" screens now *only* show tabs a user permitted
          to see.  Used in combination with carefully selected roles, 
          this change provides an adaptable management interface.

        - Instance homes can now have local Products directories.

        - There is a new ZServer start up script that can be used without
          modification and that integrates process management.  This
          script replaces the ZServer 'start.py' and 'zinit.py' scripts.

        - When the new startup script is used, then the control panel
          shows a "Restart" button which causes the Zope process to
          exit and be restarted and a "Shutdown" button that causes Zope 
	  to exit and not be restarted.

        - There is a *very* rough cut at a centralized version manager
          in the control panel.  This is only functional when the
          ZODB3 database is used.  This feature will mature
          significantly before the final 2.0 release.
   
        - A new Zope icon was added, and the "powered by Zope" icon
          has been updated.

        - Made DTMLDocuments, DTMLMethods, Images, Files and Folders
	  subclassable by ZClasses.

	- ZClass property sheets can now have read and modify
          permissions.

	- An "add list" name can be specified when creating a ZClass.
	  If specified, then construction methods and a factory are
	  created. This makes the class immediately instantiatable and
	  provides construction method examples.

        - The ZClass basic property sheet now shows base classes.

	- Changed the string representation of HTTPRequest so that
          <!--#var REQUEST--> is a lot friendlier.
 
        - Added a Zope debugging short cut.  

	  Now::

	    import ZPublisher
	    ZPublisher.Zope(path)

	  is a shortcut for::

	    import ZPublisher
	    ZPublisher.test('Zope', path)

      Bugs Fixed

        - ZClass permission setting interfaces didn't show inherited
          permissions.

        - A number of bugs arising from attempts to set 
	  caching headers were fixed.

        - Some default permissions were not set correctly.

        - The unused non-functioning resource-consuming Scheduler has
	  been removed.

        - Access was given to objects without roles even if access
          would be denied to the container.

        - Fix submitted by Martijn Pieters:

	  Any property type int or long, set to 0, showed up in the
	  Properties Management tab as blank. This resulted in errors
	  when trying to change values of other properties, etc.

        - Version names were computed incorrectly.

        - Delete and rename were broken for ZClasses.

        - It wasn't possible to override inherited attributes with
          methods in ZClasses.

        - Property values were not removed from ZClasses when property
          sheets were deleted.  This made it impossible to re-add a
          property from a deleted property sheet.

        - Generated property view and edit forms for ZClass property
          sheets had a number of problems.

	- The propertysheets property sheet should only allow addition of
	  property sheets.

    Zope 1.11.0 pr1, which should have been named Zope 2.0.0 alpha 0.
      
      Lots has changed in this release. The major news is ZClasses and WebDAV.
      
      Features Added

        - Added WebDAV support. See http://webdav.zope.org/ for details.

        - Added Z Classes. Documentation is forthcoming.

          ZClasses might be viewed as somewhat experimental, although
          we're using them aggressively for internal projects.

        - Added Property Sheets. Documentation is forthcoming.
        
        - ZServer now included in distribution.
        
        - Added new product registration interface. Documentation is
          forthcoming.

        - Added local roles which allow for permission settings for
          users on individual objects. This allows for 'ownership' of Zope
          objects. Added 'Owner' role to default roles, and automatic
          setting of the 'Owner' role on a created object to the user who
          created it.
        
        - Added hooks for XML-RPC support to ZPublisher. See the source
          for details. XML-RPC support is not yet finished.
        
        - Added automatic height/width detection for JPEG images.

        - Revised Zope error messages.

        - A new DTML 'try' tag added based on work by Jordan B. Baker.
          See the source for details. Documentation is forthcoming.

        - A new DTML 'mime' tag has been added. See the MIMETools README.txt
          for more information.

        - A new 'range' function added the the '_' DTML variable. 

        - A new 'utilities' directory is included in the distribution.

        - A new flag attribute, 'only', of the DTML 'with' tag
          prunes the DTML namespace to only the namespace created
          with the with tag.

        - Added contributed support for encoding options in the SendMail
          tag and MailHost send method.
          
        - Mangement tabs are now prettier and allow status messages with
          the manage_tabs_message variable.
          
        - Added a method of notifying users of changes without using a
          MessageDialog. This makes editing DTML Documents and Methods
          easier.
          
        - Added more documentation to Product add screens.

        - New icons for many Zope objects.

        - Sessions are now known as Versions.

        - Changed from using 'manage_main' as default management method to use
          'manage_workspace' which is a reserved method that dispatches to the
          default management interface which is the first interface defined
          in manage_options

        - Permission settings are now inherited by Products from their base
          classes. This means when you build a Product you only need to specify
          its particular permission settings.

        - Changed ZPublisher.publish_module's interface so that instead of
          providing a stdin, stdout, and stderr, you can provide a Request and
          a Response object. ZServer makes extensive use of this feature.

        - Added methods to HTTPRequest to allow access to ZPublishers object
          traversal. HTTPRequest.clone and HTTPRequest.resolve_url. See the
          source for more details.
          
        - Added a new "builtin" function reorder to DTML.
        
          reorder(s, [with, without]])
 
          Reorder the items in s according to the order given in with
          and with items mentioned in without removed.  Items from s
          not mentioned in with are removed.

          s, with, and without are all either sequences if strings
          or sequences of key-value tuples, with ordering done on the
          keys.

          This function is useful for constructing ordered select lists.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Added small fixes to ZopeHTTPServer in anticipation of DAV.

        - Construction, upload, and edit methods did not consistently
          support either string or file data.  This caused really weird
          behavior when file upload was used with out includeing the 
          ':string' suffix in the argument name when doing a file upload.

          This bug was previously (and incorrectly) reported as a 
          ZPublisher.Client problem.

        - Errors in ExternalMethods were masked by bugs in error
          reporting logic.  The bugs were made far more effective
          by Python 1.5.1.

        - Databases (or export files) created in binary distributions
          were not usable in source distributions due to cPickle
          limitations in stock Python 1.5.1.  We now link/copy the
          cPickle extension to BoboPOS to make sure that it uses the
          latest version.

        - Fixed registration of MailHost settings and incorrect default
          quoted-printable encoding of message bodies.

        - Added contributed patch that fixes bug in copied-object id
          generation.

        - DTML Documents and Methods now attempt to determine their
          content-type rather than assuming they are text/html.

        - Fixed PUT bug in determining content-type of binary files.

        - Added changes that allow the top level userfolder to be replaced by a
          UserDB or other userfolder-like object.

        - Fixed an FTP support bug that sometimes kept simple items from
          producting FTP listings.

        - Added URL1 instead of "." as the form target for the workspace forms --
          using "." causes NS servers to intercept the request and report an
          error, making Zope effectively unusable.

        - Added ZPL 1.0 and credits to copyright link in management screen.
          
        - Fixed a bug that prevented validate() from working if the top-level
          object were accessed and no default object (index_html) existed.

	- Fixed a logic bug in security validation that allowed access to
          unacquired objects that didn't have __roles__ even if the
          containing object was protected.

    Zope  1.10.2

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a permission problem with DTMLMethod objects that caused
          errors when attempting to commit permission changes.

        - Factories could not determine the available methods
          when they were being edited, making them uneditable.

    Zope  1.10.1

      This is a Python 1.5.2 beta 2 compatability release.

      A Python C API change in Python 1.5.2 beta 2 broke
      Zope.  This release contains a fix.

      Zope should work correctly with Python 1.5, 1.5.1 and
      beta versions of 1.5.2.

    Zope  1.10.0

      New Features

        - Added Import/Export interfaces to Folders.

      Bugs Fixed

        - Fixed a bug in ZopeHTTPServer which caused it to fail on POST
          requests without content-type headers.

        - PUT and file uploads would fail if the content-type could
          not be determined. Now objects created via PUT and file
          upload will default to either 'application/octet-stream'
          for binary files or 'text/plain' for non-binary files if
          no content-type can be determined from headers or filename
          extensions.

        - Fixed a permission bug left from a change to the Find support.

        - Fixed misc typos in docstrings and docs.

        - Fixed a bug that kept objects from being freed from the cache!
          Basically, there was never a check for inactive objects.

        - MailHost objects didn't do appropriate CRLF conversion or
          recognize 4xx server responses.

    Zope  1.10.0 pr1

      New Features

        - Documents generated by the search interface wizard
          no longer use tab characters.

        - Added a -s option to ZopeHTTPServer.  This is useful
          for emulating older sites when generating screen shots
          for creating or updating documentation.

        - Default bobobase now includes a Zope button along with a link
          to the Zope site. This satisfies the ZPL attribution requirement.
          The button is created by a new builtin method
          'ZopeAttributionButton'. Also, both the source and the binary
          distributions now have the same default bobobase.

        - Made the logic for getting SOFTWARE_HOME a bit more robust, so that 
          it handles relative paths and paths starting with '.' and '..'.
          This is useful when simply importing Main from the Python
          prompt in the lib/python directory.

        - The ThreadLock module has been changed to reflect changes
          in the Python API in Python 1.5.2.

        - The '_' variable in DTML now has the random module
          as an attribute and DateTime.DateTime as the attribute DateTime.

        - Added keys() and items() methods to the REQUEST object.

        - Added get_header() method to the REQUEST object for retrieving
          HTTP headers.

        - New SearchIndex package and BTree component have been added to 
          the distribution, providing low-level support for products with
          built-in searching such as Tabula and Confera.

        - Documents have now been split into two distinct object types:
          DTML Documents and DTML Methods. DTML Methods behave exactly
          as Document objects did. DTML Documents are similar except that
          the "client" or "self" of a DTML Document is the DTML Document
          itself rather than its parent, and DTML Documents can have
          properties.

        - DTML Documents, Image and File objects can now have properties.

        - A new PropertyManager mixin class allows developers to easily
          add properties and property management to non-Folder objects.

        - Added a new absolute_url method which can generate an absolute
          url for the object on which the method is called.

        - GIF and PNG Images now figure out their own dimensions when
          uploaded. Image height and width properties are now editable.

        - Images now generate themselves as html IMG tags, using an absolute
          url and correct height and width tags if possible.

        - There is a new form input type, boolean, for inputing boolean
          data.

        - Added a read_only option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors to open a database in read_only
          mode.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_READ_ONLY, used by the
          Zope framework.  If this variable is set, then the database
          is opened in read only mode.  If this variable is set to a
          string parsable by DateTime.DateTime, then the database is
          opened read-only as of the time given.  Note that changes
          made by another process after the database has been opened
          are not visible.

        - Added a database_quota option to the SimpleDB.MultipleRevision and 
          PickleDictionary constructors and a
          SimpleDB.MultipleRevision.set_quota method to set a database
          quota. The quota is given as either an integer number of
          bytes, or a function taking an integer number of bytes
          argument and returning whether the quota has been exceeded.

        - Added an environment variable, ZOPE_DATABASE_QUOTA, used by the
          Zope framework. If this variable is set, it should be set to
          an integer number of bytes.  Additions to the database are
          not allowed if the database size exceeds the quota.          

        - Added size and last modification time to DTML Method and DTML
          Document edit interface.

        - Added a new module, BoboPOS.winlock, that provides file
          locking on windows.  This should prevent many cases of data
          corruption. 

        - Added FTP support to Documents, Files, Images, and Folders.
          FTP interface is detailed in OFS/FTPInterface.py though it may
          change. Basic FTP support was also added to SimpleItem to make
          it easier for Zope objects to support FTP.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Permissions for manage_clone method were wrong, meaning that
          essentially only managers could use it.

        - File paths that showed up in tracebacks reflected the paths the 
          files had when they were compiled (at distribution build-time).
          The compiled-in paths have been changed to be relative to the
          Zope installation directory.

        - Fixed a bug in ZPublisher's special handling the "cancel"
          submit buttons. The test for the cancel button was case
          sensitive.  I changed it so it would accept any case, as
          well as extra spaces.

          Cancel buttons should probably be handled using the new
          :method form type, but this would require the presense of an
          appropriate redirect method.  Perhaps there should be
          a :redirect form type.

        - Date strings with years < 31 were not accepted, even
          through the documentation says they should be.

        - If Zope crashed or was unable to completely write a database
          record, then on restart, a data corruption error was reported.
          Now, truncated records are removed if necessary on start up.
          If necessary, other records are removed as well to avoid 
          partially-written transactions.

        - Lack of sys.argv in the win32 service version of Zope caused 
          it to raise errors under certain conditions.

        - Several HTTP PUT related bugs were fixed.

        - Simple items did not have an objectValues method, which caused
          odd behavior in certain tree tags since the method would be
          acquired from the parent of the simple item.

        - The Find form in the management interface depended on javascript
          to function properly.

        - Added a fix to compensate for the fact that Apache servers may 
          rename the entire cgi environment when mod_rewrite rules are 
          used in .htaccess files.

        - If system clocks were changed, so that database records 
          had records in the "future", then database corruption could
          either occur or be incorrectly reported.  Now this situation
          results in an informative error message and corruption does
          not occur.

    Zope 1.9.0

      New Features

        - Zope now provides better information about products.  If a 
          Product has a README.txt, then it will be readable through
          the product management interface.   

          If a product encounters an error during startup, the
          traceback is available through the product management
          interface.

        - Cache statistics are displayed in minutes, rather than
          seconds.

        - Products can define the attribute '__module_aliases__' in
          their '__init__' modules that specifies aliases for modules
          used in the product.  This is useful if module names have
          changed and the database contains pickles refering to the
          old modules.  The attribute should be a sequence of
          tuples. Each tuple has a (dotted) module name and a module.

      Bugs Fixed
 
        - Development on ZopeHTTPServer has been frozen in anticipation
          of the switch to Medusa. Therefor ZopeHTTPServer still does
          support PUT. Sorry.

        - ZPublisher.Client used the obsolete rand module.

        - Errors occuring during product import caused Zope to fail to come
          up.

        - Product version information was not displayed correctly.

        - ZGadflyDA cached table meta-data which lead to missleading
          information when browsing databases.

    Zope 1.9 beta 3

      New Features

        - Z SQL Methods (FKA Aqueduct) and the Z Gadfly Database Adapter
          are now included.

        - The argument handling for ZopeHTTPServer has been changed to 
          be a bit more flexible wrt the order of argumements.  
          While options must still come first, environment settings
          can be given in any order.  This makes startup scripts loke
          serve.py quite a bit simpler.

        - ZopeHTTPServer now sports preliminary support for PUT publishing.
          
        - ZopeHTTPServer now serves from port 9673 by default, not 8080.

      Bugs fixed

        - The start.bat file used to start ZopeHTTPServer on win32 was
          misnamed and didn't correctly pass command-line arguments.

        - Win32 machines without an existing Python installation had problems
          due to PYTHONPATH bootstrapping.

        - The included ZopeHTTPServer was failing to start correctly on
          win32 machines that were not connected to the network.

    Zope 1.9 beta 2

      In addition to various documentation updates, this release includes:

      New Features

        - Changed serve.py to accept ZopeHTTPServer command-line options.

        - Added a -P option to the ZopeHTTPServer to specify a file
          to contain the process ID.  This allows a script to stop
          the process on Unix.

        - Added support for the environment variables, Z_REALM and
          Z_DEBUG_MODE to set an authentication realm and to
          enable debug mode.

      Bugs fixed

        - External methods were broken due to differences in 
          Python 1.4 and Python 1.5 comparison semantics.

        - ZopeHTTPServer command-line environment settings
          were not available in os.environ.

        - Some class references were wrong in examples in the ExtensionClass
          documentation.

        - INSTANCE_HOME was not set correctly when the debugger was run
          with a relative path to the published module.

        - The #! line in the ZopeHTTPServer was hidden by the copyright
          statement and didn't have the right path.

        - A bug in pcgi_publisher.py caused file uploads larger than 1 MB
          to fail.

    Zope 1.9 beta 1

      Bugs fixed:

        - pcgi did not build correctly on Solaris 2.6

        - links in headers were broken when Zope was reached with
          /, as is the case when the ZopeHTTPServer is used.

        - Python sources used tabs and spaces for indentation, which
          made some people unhappy.

        - Copyright statements were missing or out of date.
        
        - Added better instructions for building and running Zope.

        - Added new Zope License and attribution information.

        - Merged BoboHTTPServer updates with ZopeHTTPServer. Including 
          socket changes to allow easier stopping and starting.

        - Shutting down the ZopeHTTPServer from the application
          caused an empty document to be returned.

        - The install scripts failed if run more than once when attempting
          to create a var directory.

      Features

        - Added (and old version of) the zlib module to make
          installation simpler.

        - Zope requires an access file.  The install scripts now create
          one.

    Zope 1.9 alpha 1 

      This was the inital Zope test release.

  Futures

    Things we plan to happen real soon (maybe next release)

      Features

       - include a serve shell script along the lines of:
   
           #!/bin/sh
           python serve.py > var/serve.log 2> var/serve.errors &
   
         Note that this script should be written by the installers
         and use sys.executable.

         (Brian)

      Bugs

       - Chase down weird bugs reported by Michel Pelletier.

    Things to do sometime

      Features

        - Better deamon management for ZopeHTTPServer, Medusa,
          and pcgi-LRP (when pcgi wrapper gets out of process
          management business).

          (Note that there is some experimental code along these
           lines in principia main.)

       - Need make_clean.py that:
   
         - runs make clobber for the extensions
   
         - runs make clean in pcgi
   
         - prints an message reminding user to manually remove var
   
         (brian)

       - The default access file should be handled a little differently.
         The installer should make people enter values, the default
         should have a randomly generated password, or the default should
         be ommitted.
