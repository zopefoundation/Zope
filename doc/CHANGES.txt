    Zope 2.4 alpha 2

      Features Added

        - Made the meta-type in the upper-left corner of ZClass instances'
          management interface into a link to the ZClass definition.

        - Collector #2316: introduced new environment variable ZSYSLOG_FACILITY
          to override the default syslog facility 'user'

      Bugs fixed

        - Corrections to the code that adds interface information to the
          meta type registry.

        - Collector #2274: fixed typo in Transaction.py. Made Connection.py
          a bit more noisy in case of failure

        - Collector #2273: fixed bug in STXNG (unable to handle :img: 
          commands with absolute URLs)

        - Collector #2272: fixed problem in Transaction.py (Objects
          with id==None could not print themselves)

        - fixed Python module import problems causing XML export/import
          too be completely broken
    
        - Collector #2270: fixed import problem when $INSTANCE_HOME  
          was set

        - Collector #2269: default script for PythonScript is no longer
          compiled during installation

        - Updated to zlib 1.1.3.

        - fixed parenthesis handling for TextIndex queries

        - Collector #2283: PersistentMapping class keys() method now returns
          a *copy* of the cached keys list instead of the cached list of
          keys itself.  This prevents mutation of the list.

        - DateTime constructor now accepts ISO 8601 compliant dates

        - Collector #2254: added hook for webdav/ftp MKCOL

        - Collector #2247: put values of properties into CDATA section  to 
          prevent non XML compliant documents to be sent to a webdav client.

        - Collector #2287: fixed missing import of 'render_blocks' in 
          SendMailTag.py

        - Collector #2289: leading \n\r inside messageText broke
          mail headers

        - Collector #2290: better handling of subject header in Mailhost.py

        - Collector #2291: fixed cookie path in Zope Version Control 

        - Collector #2286: Could not create ZClasses.  coptimizations.c
          had been corrected erroneously.  Fixed.

        - It was discovered that the implicit names of certain DTMLMethods
          were ambiguous, making security assertions for them unpredictable.
          Code was added to detect the condition and correct it in the
          Zope core.  The affected DTML methods did not pose a security risk.
          Instead, most were overprotective.

        - "print" with a trailing comma (to avoid a newline) caused
          spurious errors in Python Scripts.  It turned out the compiler
          module was in error.  Fixed.

        - Collector #2306:  Fixed broken glossary of Zope Tutorial
        
        - Collector #2305: A comma inside an optional parameter of the
          parameter string broke the ZScriptHTML_tryParams function of
          PythonScripts.

    Zope 2.4 alpha 1

      Features Added

        - Zope now requires Python 2.1. See the Zope 2.4 migration 
          document for details:

          http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.4.0/Zope24MigrationGuide.html

        - The 'Authenticated' role has been added as one of Zope's
          standard roles.  A user's possession of this role indicates
          that he or she has been authenticated by the Zope security
          machinery.  It is an implicit role, and cannot be provided to
          users within the user management screens or the local roles
          management screens.  It is provided to all authenticated users.
          Another way to think of the 'Authenticated' role is that
          it is possessed by all users *except* the Anonymous User.

        - A module 'requestprofiler.py' is now part of the utilities
          directory.  When run from the command line, this utility
          allows you to generate profiling information from Zope's
          detailed request log (the "-M" log).

        - Restricted code can import AccessControl.getSecurityManager,
          and use 'validate', 'validateValue', 'checkPermission',
          'getUser', and 'calledByExecutable'.

        - Zope's WebDAV support now includes exclusive write locking.

        - Data.fs.in index_html now shows zope_quick_start instead
          of old, inaccurate content.

        - Changed index_html, standard_html_header, standard_html_footer,
          and standard_error_message in Data.fs.in to use "new" DTML syntax
          (as opposed to SSI-style syntax).

        - Added check for 'FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD' environ var to bits which
          try to detect whether we're a ZEO client or not in order not to
          skip product-loading tasks.  This has the consequence that a ZEO
          client with the "ZEO_CLIENT" env var set will cause product
          loading tasks to occur iff his "FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD" environment
          var is set as well.

        - Further optimizations in the lexicon of the Catalog as well
          as the final merge code integration for Text indexes.  This
          should reduce the bloat when things are reindexed.  

        - StructuredText: old StructuredText replaces by StructuredTextNG.
          Added support for locale settings.  Several bugfixes and code
          cleanup.

        - Image and File objects now support the HTTP Range and If-Range
          headers, enabeling partial downloads of such objects. This can be
          used by clients to restart a broken download. Downloads of these
          objects through FTP can also be restarted.

        - Update of Medusa tree to latest version

        - If an INSTANCE_HOME is defined and has a 'lib/python'
          subdirectory, it will be added to the front of the Python path.

        - DTML-In and DTML-Tree now have optional "prefix" attributes
          that can be used to make friendlier tag variable names.

        - Added product reloading capability, formerly provided by
          the "Refresh" product.  This enables developers to see the
          effect of changes to their products without restarting Zope.

        - Added new 'sequence' module for underscore namespace to provide
          extended sorting functionality for sequence (implements
          ExtendedDTMLSorting proposal)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.

        - Rewrote the complete indexing infrastructure according
          to the DropinIndex proposal
          (see lib/python/Products/PlugginIndexes/README.txt for 
          detailed informations). 

        - Adopted ZCatalog to new indexing infrastructure. 
                                  
        - added text() method to HTTPRequest object to provide a plain 
          text representation of the request (Collector #2264)
        
      Bugs Fixed

        - TextIndexes which called methods expecting an argument failed
          with a TypeError.  This was fixed by extending an exception
          handler.

        - A security issue having to do with setting permission mappings
          on ZClass methods was fixed (this supersedes Hotfix-2001-05-01)

        - Automatic reloading of Help topics while running in debug mode
          was fixed.

        - Fixed problem adding propertynames with spaces (Collector #2206)

        - Plugged a memory leak in extensions.  There are often circular
          references in code generated by Python's "exec" statement but
          with a small change extensions now break those references.

        - Hardened ZMI contents view against subobjects w/ flaky
          'get_size' (Collector #1900).

        - Fixed OFS.CopySupport's _verifyObjectPaste to utilize the
          permission stored in the metatype registry, if available
          (Collector #1975)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.
