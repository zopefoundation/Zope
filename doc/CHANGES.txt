Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release. 
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.

    Features Added

      - New user management API for user folder objects was implemented.

        As of Zope 2.5, manage_addUser, manage_editUser and manage_delUsers
        form the official API for user management. The old grotesque way of
        using manage_users is now deprecated. 

        The default implementation of these API methods simply call the
        _doXXX versions of the methods that user folder authors have already
        implemented, which means that these APIs will work for current user
        folder implementations without any action on the part of the author.

        User folder authors that implement the new manage_XXX API can get
        rid of the old _doXXX versions of the methods, which are no longer
        required (we only use them if the new api is not directly implemented).

        API documentation for the User Folder API was also added to
        the help system.

      - Python compiler in RestrictedPython brought in sync with
        main distribution.  Made to be compatible with Python 2.2.

      - Added links in the "debugging information" control panel
        for viewing the contents of the ZODB cache.

      - Added user password encryption capability, fulfilling the
        needs described in the proposal at:
        http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Proposals/EncryptedUserfolderPasswords
        There is now a "properties" tab in user folders where you
        can select whether passwords are stored encrypted.

      - Locale support in STXNG has been broken (since 2.4.0)

      - Added SOFTWARE_HOME, INSTANCE_HOME, and CLIENT_HOME to the
        control panel to make it easer to tell what configuration of
        Zope is running.

      - Re-applied Medusa patch to allow proxy-like HTTP requests
        (GET http://hostname:port/ HTTP/1.0)

      - Objects indexed by the PathIndex can now provide a hook or an 
        attribute with the same name as the index name to provide
        a customized path information other than using getPhysicalPath().

      - Selecting "Clear Catalog" from the ZCatalog "Advanced" did not clear
        the vocabulary associated with a TextIndex. 

      - Added updated and enhanced testsuite for STXNG.

    Bugs fixed

      - Collector #2532: ZCatalog.availableSplitters is now protected
        by security mechanism.

      - Collector #2412: a read-only FileStorage has not been closed
        properly.

      - Collector #2390: Objects of type 'Help Image' were not properly
        re-registered inside registerHelp().

      - Fixed broken FTP download for larger files.

      - Collector # 2396: StructuredText did not allow URLs containing "%"

      - Collector # 2397: StructuredText could not handle underlined text
        properly. Also <dtml-var stxdoc ftm=structured-text> will no longer
        produce <html>..<body>  and </body>..</html>

      - Collector #2438:  Using a slice operation like [30:] on a 
        ZCatalog search result caused a MemoryError because 
        the __getslice__ implementation used  range() instead
        of xrange().

      - Collector #2423: Searching a FieldIndexes for documents
        with a blank string has been broken.

      - WebDAV Lockmanager was not working due to a Python 2.1 
        incompatibility.

      - Collector #2482: A COPY operation through WebDAV on a locked
        resource left the destination resource in a locked state
        so any WebDAV client  was unable to unlock the destination 
        object. Locks are now cleared from the destination object.

      - Error message AttributeError/_v_blocks when a DTMLfile is
        not present or could not be read replaced by a more
        informative message.

      - Collector #2497: SERVER_PROTOCOL variable is now compliant
        with the CGI specification and looks like "HTTP/1.1" instead
        of "1.1"

      - Creation of a TextIndex ignored the vocabulary setting.

      - Fixed broken aquisition of vocabularies from a Catalog
        by a TextIndex.

      - Collector #2504: level parameter has not been passed to HTMLClass
        constructor

      - default for 'orphan' attribute of <dtml-in> is now 0 instead 3.

      - Fixed conflict resolution problem in BTrees (BTreeTemplace/
        _p_resolveConflict)

      - Collector #2524: Medusa sent "HTTP/None..." as response header when
        then HTTP version could not be determined from the HTTP request.
        Now sending "HTTP/1.0..."

      - queries for the PathIndex can now specified as tuple (path,level).
        the level parameter inside a query overrides the optional 
        'level' parameter for a complete search request.

      - Collector #2561: XXBucket.values() returned keys instead of values 

      - Fixed the API docs for user objects.

      - Fixed bad interaction between ZCatalog and dtml-in (submitted by
        Steve Alexander)
   
      - Multiple links in a paragraph with mixed link notation
        (quotation+colon+URL or quotation+comma+whitespace+URL) did not
        work properly (thanks to Alastair Burt for reporting and submitting 
        the patch).

    Zope 2.4 beta 2

      Bugs fixed

        - Some of the import shenanigans in ZService.py were still 
          trying to load Python 1.5 versions of support dlls for running 
          as a service under win32 (meaning you effectively couldn't).

        - Collector #2335: older products like GadflyDA that did not
          use registerClass() were registered but their visibility
          flag has not been set to Global.  So these products did not
          appear in the ZMF.


    Zope 2.4 beta 1

      Features Added

        - Added a new lesson to the Zope tutorial which shows how to
          insert data into a relational database.

        - Made the meta-type in the upper-left corner of ZClass instances'
          management interface into a link to the ZClass definition.

        - Collector #2316: introduced new environment variable ZSYSLOG_FACILITY
          to override the default syslog facility 'user'

      Bugs fixed

        - Updated the Zope tutorial a bit. Now it references the Zope
          Book and the online help's DTML reference. Replaced ZopeTime
          examples with DateTime in lesson 9.

        - The manage_afterClone hook was called too early for copied objects,
          before the cloned object was reattached to its context. This 
          caused problems with CatalogAware objects reindexing themselves 
          on copy.

        - Fixed a situation that could slow down lazy processing of sorted 
          search results.

        - Product import ordering has been changed.  Now, the total set of
          all Products are initialized in ascending alphabetical order by
          product name, regardless of whether an INSTANCE_HOME exists.
          If two products with the same name exist in both SOFTWARE_HOME
          and INSTANCE_HOME, the order in which they appear in
          Application.Products.__path__ determines whether they
          are loaded first or second.

        - Collector #2318: html_quote function re-aliased into
          DT_Util so as not to break existing user code.

        - Corrections to the code that adds interface information to the
          meta type registry.

        - Collector #2274: fixed typo in Transaction.py. Made Connection.py
          a bit more noisy in case of failure

        - Collector #2273: fixed bug in STXNG (unable to handle :img: 
          commands with absolute URLs)

        - Collector #2272: fixed problem in Transaction.py (Objects
          with id==None could not print themselves)

        - fixed Python module import problems causing XML export/import
          too be completely broken
    
        - Collector #2270: fixed import problem when $INSTANCE_HOME  
          was set

        - Collector #2269: default script for PythonScript is no longer
          compiled during installation

        - Updated to zlib 1.1.3.

        - fixed parenthesis handling for TextIndex queries

        - Collector #2283: PersistentMapping class keys() method now returns
          a *copy* of the cached keys list instead of the cached list of
          keys itself.  This prevents mutation of the list.

        - DateTime constructor now accepts ISO 8601 compliant dates

        - Collector #2254: added hook for webdav/ftp MKCOL

        - Collector #2247: put values of properties into CDATA section  to 
          prevent non XML compliant documents to be sent to a webdav client.

        - Collector #2287: fixed missing import of 'render_blocks' in 
          SendMailTag.py

        - Collector #2289: leading \n\r inside messageText broke
          mail headers

        - Collector #2290: better handling of subject header in Mailhost.py

        - Collector #2291: fixed cookie path in Zope Version Control 

        - Collector #2286: Could not create ZClasses.  coptimizations.c
          had been corrected erroneously.  Fixed.

        - It was discovered that the implicit names of certain DTMLMethods
          were ambiguous, making security assertions for them unpredictable.
          Code was added to detect the condition and correct it in the
          Zope core.  The affected DTML methods did not pose a security risk.
          Instead, most were overprotective.

        - "print" with a trailing comma (to avoid a newline) caused
          spurious errors in Python Scripts.  It turned out the compiler
          module was in error.  Fixed.

        - Collector #2306:  Fixed broken glossary of Zope Tutorial
        
        - Collector #2305: A comma inside an optional parameter of the
          parameter string broke the ZScriptHTML_tryParams function of
          PythonScripts.

        - Restored performance of security checks in DTML and
          Scripts (Python) by replacing read guards with function calls to
          guarded_getattr() and guarded_getitem() of ZopeGuards.

        - Restricted the target of PythonScript print statements.

        - Python 2.1 reopened the old "AttributeError: __call__" bug.
          Checked in a fix that should finally solve it correctly.

    Zope 2.4 alpha 1

      Features Added

        - Zope now requires Python 2.1. See the Zope 2.4 migration 
          document for details:

          http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.4.0/Zope24MigrationGuide.html

        - The 'Authenticated' role has been added as one of Zope's
          standard roles.  A user's possession of this role indicates
          that he or she has been authenticated by the Zope security
          machinery.  It is an implicit role, and cannot be provided to
          users within the user management screens or the local roles
          management screens.  It is provided to all authenticated users.
          Another way to think of the 'Authenticated' role is that
          it is possessed by all users *except* the Anonymous User.

        - A module 'requestprofiler.py' is now part of the utilities
          directory.  When run from the command line, this utility
          allows you to generate profiling information from Zope's
          detailed request log (the "-M" log).

        - Restricted code can import AccessControl.getSecurityManager,
          and use 'validate', 'validateValue', 'checkPermission',
          'getUser', and 'calledByExecutable'.

        - Zope's WebDAV support now includes exclusive write locking.

        - Data.fs.in index_html now shows zope_quick_start instead
          of old, inaccurate content.

        - Changed index_html, standard_html_header, standard_html_footer,
          and standard_error_message in Data.fs.in to use "new" DTML syntax
          (as opposed to SSI-style syntax).

        - Added check for 'FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD' environ var to bits which
          try to detect whether we're a ZEO client or not in order not to
          skip product-loading tasks.  This has the consequence that a ZEO
          client with the "ZEO_CLIENT" env var set will cause product
          loading tasks to occur iff his "FORCE_PRODUCT_LOAD" environment
          var is set as well.

        - Further optimizations in the lexicon of the Catalog as well
          as the final merge code integration for Text indexes.  This
          should reduce the bloat when things are reindexed.  

        - StructuredText: old StructuredText replaces by StructuredTextNG.
          Added support for locale settings.  Several bugfixes and code
          cleanup.

        - Image and File objects now support the HTTP Range and If-Range
          headers, enabeling partial downloads of such objects. This can be
          used by clients to restart a broken download. Downloads of these
          objects through FTP can also be restarted.

        - Update of Medusa tree to latest version

        - If an INSTANCE_HOME is defined and has a 'lib/python'
          subdirectory, it will be added to the front of the Python path.

        - DTML-In and DTML-Tree now have optional "prefix" attributes
          that can be used to make friendlier tag variable names.

        - Added product reloading capability, formerly provided by
          the "Refresh" product.  This enables developers to see the
          effect of changes to their products without restarting Zope.

        - Added new 'sequence' module for underscore namespace to provide
          extended sorting functionality for sequence (implements
          ExtendedDTMLSorting proposal)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.

        - Rewrote the complete indexing infrastructure according
          to the DropinIndex proposal
          (see lib/python/Products/PlugginIndexes/README.txt for 
          detailed informations). 

        - Adopted ZCatalog to new indexing infrastructure. 
                                  
        - added text() method to HTTPRequest object to provide a plain 
          text representation of the request (Collector #2264)
        
      Bugs Fixed

        - TextIndexes which called methods expecting an argument failed
          with a TypeError.  This was fixed by extending an exception
          handler.

        - A security issue having to do with setting permission mappings
          on ZClass methods was fixed (this supersedes Hotfix-2001-05-01)

        - Automatic reloading of Help topics while running in debug mode
          was fixed.

        - Fixed problem adding propertynames with spaces (Collector #2206)

        - Plugged a memory leak in extensions.  There are often circular
          references in code generated by Python's "exec" statement but
          with a small change extensions now break those references.

        - Hardened ZMI contents view against subobjects w/ flaky
          'get_size' (Collector #1900).

        - Fixed OFS.CopySupport's _verifyObjectPaste to utilize the
          permission stored in the metatype registry, if available
          (Collector #1975)

        - Fixed a long-standing bug in FileStorage that made it so
          versions were only partially committed.
