    Zope 2.3.0
    
      Features Added

	- **This is the trunk version of CHANGES.txt. Please put only 
            new features here. Bug fixes should be fixed on both the 
            trunk and current release branch, but the note for a bug 
            fix should go into the CHANGES.txt of the current release 
            branch (which is where the next bug-fix release will be 
            made from).**

        - Added the __replaceable__ property support to ObjectManager.
            This is currently documented only in the Wiki.

        - Added unit tests for the DateTime module.
