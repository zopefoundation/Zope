Zope Changes

  This file contains change information for the current Zope release. 
  Change information for previous versions of Zope can be found in the
  file HISTORY.txt.


    Features Added

      - added doc/ENVIRONMENT.txt to document all used environment
        variables Zope is using

    Bugs Fixed
    
      - STXNG: added '+' as allowed character inside URLs

      - enhanced the checks for 'Domains' field in the UserFolder

      - Webdav: fixed broken MOVE and COPY commands
        

  Zope 2.5 Alpha 2

    Bugs Fixed
    
      - New accelerated security management bugfix in App/Manager.py,
        changing calling sequence to positional parameters.

      - STXNG: re-enabled inner now work also through DTML
        and not only when using STXNG standalone

  Zope 2.5 Alpha 1

    Features Added

      - re-enabled inner links for STXNG documents.

      - Zope installations upgraded from pre-2.4 installations
        did not show the WebDAV LockManager entry in the control panel.

      - "requestprofiler.py" script in utilities now does better analysis,
        including:

        "active" in detailed output is now slightly more meaningful.
        It is > 0 only if other requests started after it started
        but before it finished.  The greater the active count, the
        more likely it is that something was going on at the time
        in which the request ran that caused a slowdown.

        Multiple files may be analyzed at the same time.

        Also, script recognizes "U" opcode in big M logs as meaning a restart.

      - Added a "preview" field to the edit form for Image
        objects. This provides a preview of the actual image data on 
        the form to make it easier to know what you are working
        on. The preview image is scaled if necessary to be useful
        without being obtrusive.

      - Added the ability to edit File object content in a
        textarea. If the content of a File is a text type and the size
        is less than 64K (the max size for text area data in some Web
        browsers), then you can edit the content as you would a DTML
        or other text-based object.

      - New user management API for user folder objects was implemented.

        As of Zope 2.5, manage_addUser, manage_editUser and manage_delUsers
        form the official API for user management. The old grotesque way of
        using manage_users is now deprecated. 

        The default implementation of these API methods simply call the
        _doXXX versions of the methods that user folder authors have already
        implemented, which means that these APIs will work for current user
        folder implementations without any action on the part of the author.

        User folder authors that implement the new manage_XXX API can get
        rid of the old _doXXX versions of the methods, which are no longer
        required (we only use them if the new api is not directly implemented).

        API documentation for the User Folder API was also added to
        the help system.

      - Python compiler in RestrictedPython brought in sync with
        main distribution.  Made to be compatible with Python 2.2.

      - Added links in the "debugging information" control panel
        for viewing the contents of the ZODB cache.

      - Added user password encryption capability, fulfilling the
        needs described in the proposal at:
        http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Proposals/EncryptedUserfolderPasswords
        There is now a "properties" tab in user folders where you
        can select whether passwords are stored encrypted.

      - Locale support in STXNG has been broken (since 2.4.0)

      - Added SOFTWARE_HOME, INSTANCE_HOME, and CLIENT_HOME to the
        control panel to make it easer to tell what configuration of
        Zope is running.

      - Re-applied Medusa patch to allow proxy-like HTTP requests
        (GET http://hostname:port/ HTTP/1.0)

      - Objects indexed by the PathIndex can now provide a hook or an 
        attribute with the same name as the index name to provide
        a customized path information other than using getPhysicalPath().

      - Selecting "Clear Catalog" from the ZCatalog "Advanced" did not clear
        the vocabulary associated with a TextIndex. 

      - Added updated and enhanced testsuite for STXNG.

      - added getEntryForObject() for PathIndexes. Reworked PathIndex's
        internal inverse index.

      - API help topics can now document functions as well as classes.

      - Security accelerations in c

      - Accelerated C Document Template handling; Document Templates
        can now do additional rendering in C, improving performance.

      - Unicode support for ZCatalog: 

        - added new UnicodeSplitter

        - ZCatalog now allows unicode strings as attributes
          of objects to be indexed using a TextIndex
          (see lib/python/ZCatalog/README.txt)
     

    Bugs fixed

      - WebDAV: Zope escaped nested object properties derived from
        internal dav__* functions in PropertySheets.py although they
        are considered to be safe and do not need any escaping. This 
        caused Zope to be completely incomplete with Windows XP. Fixed !

      - WebDAV: '(' and ')' are now allowed in Ids for Zope objects.
        This is needed when one tries to duplicate files using cut&paste
        through Microsoft webfolders.

      - Collector #2532: ZCatalog.availableSplitters is now protected
        by security mechanism.

      - Collector #2412: a read-only FileStorage has not been closed
        properly.

      - Collector #2390: Objects of type 'Help Image' were not properly
        re-registered inside registerHelp().

      - Fixed broken FTP download for larger files.

      - Collector # 2396: StructuredText did not allow URLs containing "%"

      - Collector # 2397: StructuredText could not handle underlined text
        properly. Also <dtml-var stxdoc fmt="structured-text"> will no longer
        produce <html>..<body>  and </body>..</html>

      - Collector #2438:  Using a slice operation like [30:] on a 
        ZCatalog search result caused a MemoryError because 
        the __getslice__ implementation used  range() instead
        of xrange().

      - Collector #2423: Searching a FieldIndexes for documents
        with a blank string has been broken.

      - WebDAV Lockmanager was not working due to a Python 2.1 
        incompatibility.

      - Collector #2482: A COPY operation through WebDAV on a locked
        resource left the destination resource in a locked state
        so any WebDAV client  was unable to unlock the destination 
        object. Locks are now cleared from the destination object.

      - Error message AttributeError/_v_blocks when a DTMLfile is
        not present or could not be read replaced by a more
        informative message.

      - Collector #2497: SERVER_PROTOCOL variable is now compliant
        with the CGI specification and looks like "HTTP/1.1" instead
        of "1.1"

      - Creation of a TextIndex ignored the vocabulary setting.

      - Fixed broken aquisition of vocabularies from a Catalog
        by a TextIndex.

      - Collector #2504: level parameter has not been passed to HTMLClass
        constructor

      - default for 'orphan' attribute of <dtml-in> is now 0 instead 3.

      - Fixed conflict resolution problem in BTrees (BTreeTemplace/
        _p_resolveConflict)

      - Collector #2524: Medusa sent "HTTP/None..." as response header when
        then HTTP version could not be determined from the HTTP request.
        Now sending "HTTP/1.0..."

      - queries for the PathIndex can now specified as tuple (path,level).
        the level parameter inside a query overrides the optional 
        'level' parameter for a complete search request.

      - Collector #2561: XXBucket.values() returned keys instead of values 

      - Fixed the API docs for user objects.

      - Fixed bad interaction between ZCatalog and dtml-in (submitted by
        Steve Alexander)
   
      - Multiple links in a paragraph with mixed link notation
        (quotation+colon+URL or quotation+comma+whitespace+URL) did not
        work properly (thanks to Alastair Burt for reporting and submitting 
        the patch).

      - Fixed case where DTMLMethod.py complained when it tried to remove
        the accelerated DTML security validation routine after recursive
	entry.
