Usage of environment variables:


Zope installation

    INSTANCE_HOME

        If an INSTANCE_HOME is defined and has a 'lib/python' sub
        directory, it will be added to the front of the Python path.
        INSTANCE_HOME is usually used to separate the Zope core
        installation from application code and third-party
        modules/products.

        See also: SOFTWARE_HOME


    SOFTWARE_HOME 
        
        The SOFTWARE_HOME usually keeps the directory name of the 
        Zope core installation.

        Order of product initialization:
            
            All Products are initialized in ascending alphabetical order by
            product name, regardless of whether an INSTANCE_HOME exists.
            If two products with the same name exist in both SOFTWARE_HOME
            and INSTANCE_HOME, the order in which they appear in
            Application.Products.__path__ determines whether they are
            loaded first or second.

        See also: INSTANCE_HOME


Profiling

    PROFILE_PUBLISHER

        If set, Zope is forced profile every request of the ZPublisher.
        The profiling information is written to the value of the
        PROFILE_PUBLISHER.


SiteAccess

    SUPPRESS_ACCESSRULE

        If set, all SiteRoots are suppressed (used by SiteAccess products).


    SUPPRESS_SITEROOT

        If set, all site access rules are suppressed (used by SiteAccess
        products).



ZEO

    CLIENT_HOME

        CLIENT_HOME allows ZEO clients to easily keep distinct pid and log
        files. This is currently an *experimental* feature. 
 

    ZEO_CLIENT
        
        If you want a persistent client cache which retains cache contents
        across ClientStorage restarts, you need to define the environment
        variable, ZEO_CLIENT, to a unique name for the client.  This is
        needed so that unique cache name files can be computed.  Otherwise,
        the client cache is stored in temporary files which are removed
        when the ClientStorage shuts down.

        

Debugging and Logging

    STUPID_LOG_FORMAT
        
        Set this variable if you like to customize the output format of
        Zope stupid logger.
        

    STUPID_LOG_FILE="path"

        The stupid file logger writes Zope logging information to a file.
        It is not very smart about it - it just dumps it to a file and the
        format is not very configurable - hence the name.

        See also: LOGGING.txt


    STUPID_LOG_SEVERITY <number>

        If set, Zope logs only messages whose severity is level
        is higher than the specified one.



    ZSYSLOG="/dev/log"

        Setting this environment variable will cause Zope to try and write
        to the named UNIX domain socket (usually '/dev/log').  This will
        only work on UNIX.

        See also: LOGGING.txt


    ZSYSLOG_FACILITY="facilityname"

        Setting this environment variable will cause Zope to use the syslog
        logger with the given facility. This environment variable is
        optional and  overrides the default facility "user". This will only
        work on UNIX.

        See also: LOGGING.txt


    ZSYSLOG_SERVER="machine.name:port"

        Setting this environment variable tells Zope to connect a UDP
        socket to machine.name (which can be a name or IP address) and
        'port' which must be an integer.  The default syslogd port is '514'
        but Zope does not pick a sane default, you must specify a port.
        This may change, so check back here in future Zope releases.

        See also: LOGGING.txt


    Z_DEBUG_MODE      "yes" or "no"
    BOBO_DEBUG_MODE   "yes" or "no"  (obsolete)
     
        Run Zope in debug mode if set. Same as -D options (z2.py)


Misc.

    Z_REALM       "your realm"
    BOBO_REALM    "your realm" (obsolete)

        Realm to be used when send HTTP authentication requests to a web
        client. The real string is displayed when the web browser pops up
        the username/password requester


Security related 

    NO_SECURITY

       Unknown. Used by TAL


    ZOPE_SECURITY_POLICY

        If this variable is set to "PYTHON", Zope will use the traditional
        Python based AccessControl implementation. By default and for
        performance reasons Zope will use the cAccessControl module (Zope
        2.5+)


    ZSP_OWNEROUS_SKIP

        If set, will cause the Zope Security Policy to skip checks relating
	to ownership, for servers on which ownership is not important.


    ZSP_AUTHENTICATED_SKIP

        If set, will cause the Zope Security Policy to skip checks relating
	to authentication, for servers which serve only anonymous content.


    DISALLOW_LOCAL_PRODUCTS

        unknown


ZODB related

    ZOPE_DATABASE_QUOTA

        If this variable is set, it should be set to an integer number of
        bytes.  Additions to the database are not allowed if the database
        size exceeds the quota. 


    ZOPE_READ_ONLY

        If this variable is set, then the database is opened in read only
        mode.  If this variable is set to a string parsable by
        DateTime.DateTime, then the database is opened read-only as of the
        time given.  Note that changes made by another process after the
        database has been opened are not visible.

Session related

    ZSESSION_ADD_NOTIFY

    	If this is set, it is the full path name in Zope of a callable
        object to be set in the addNotificationTarget of the transient_container
        which is created in temp_folder at startup.  The default is
        /session_add.  If the name does not exist, no entry will be placed
        in the addNotificationTarget of transient_container.

    ZSESSION_DEL_NOTIFY

    	If this is set, it is the full path name in Zope of a callable
        object to be set in the delNotificationTarget of the transient_container
        which is created in temp_folder at startup.  The default is
        /session_del.  If the name does not exist, no entry will be placed
        in the delNotificationTarget of transient_container.

Esoteric 

    Z_MAX_STACK_SIZE

        This variable allows you to customize the size of the Zope stack
        used by the SecurityManager (default 100).


    FORCE_PRODUCT_RELOAD

        unknown (Shane's Refresh product ???)
