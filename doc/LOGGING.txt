Zope Logging

 Zope2 now comes with a Logging facility called ZLogger.  ZLogger is
 an extensible logging system.  Currently, ZLogger will log either to a 
 file or to syslog.  (Syslog logging works even on windows, because
 it talks directly to the syslog server using UDP, instead of the
 POSIX syslog calls).

 Logging is controlled by setting environment variables.  This is done
 most easily by providing the settings on the z2.py command line.  For
 example::

  $ python1.5.2 z2.py ZSYSLOG_SERVER="syslog.mydomain.com:514" \
     STUPID_LOG_FILE=var/Zope.log"

 Currently, the following environment variables can be set:

  STUPID_LOG_FILE="path"

   The stupid file logger writes Zope logging information to a file.
   It is not very smart about it - it just dumps it to a file and the
   format is not very configurable - hence the name.

  ZSYSLOG="/dev/log"

   Setting this environment variable will cause Zope to try and write
   to the named UNIX domain socket (usually '/dev/log').  This will only 
   work on UNIX.

  ZSYSLOG_SERVER="machine.name:port"

   Setting this environment variable tells Zope to connect a UDP
   socket to machine.name (which can be a name or IP address) and
   'port' which must be an integer.  The default syslogd port is '514' 
   but Zope does not pick a sane default, you must specify a port.
   This may change, so check back here in future Zope releases.

Calling the logger in your code

 If you want your own Zope extensions to use logging:

  import zLOG
  zLOG.LOG(subsystem, severity, summary, detail, error, reraise)

 The following arguments are required:

      subsystem -- The subsystem generating the message (e.g. ZODB)

      severity -- The "severity" of the event.  This may be an integer or
                  a floating point number.  Logging back ends may
                  consider the int() of this value to be significant.
                  For example, a backend may consider any severity
                  with integer value of WARNING to be a warning.  By
                  default, the zLOG module defines the following
                  severities:

		    BLATHER=-100
		    INFO=0      
		    PROBLEM=WARNING=100             
		    ERROR=200   
		    PANIC=300

      summary -- A short summary of the event.

      detail -- A detailed description.

      error -- A three-element tuple consisting of an error type, value, and
               traceback.  If provided, then a summary of the error
               is added to the detail.

      reraise -- If provided with a true value, then the error given by
                 error is reraised.
  

Creating your own Logger

 Creating your own Zope logger is easy.  Simply define a logger class 
 with the following interface::

  class LumberJack:
      """ an ok Logger

      I sleep all night, I work all day
      """

      def __init__(self):
	  pass

      def __call__(self, sub, sev, sum, det, err):
	  print ' %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s' % (self, sub, sev, sum, det, err)


Then you must edit lib/python/Zope/ZLogger/ZLogger.py and instantiate
one of your Loggers in the 'logger' tuple::

 loggers = (stupidFileLogger.stupidFileLogger(), 
            syslogLogger.syslogLogger(),
            LumberJack.LumberJack(),)
