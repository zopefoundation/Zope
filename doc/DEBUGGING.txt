Running Zope in Debug Mode

  If you wish to run Zope in debug mode, use the -D command line
  switch.  This will have the following effect::

   o On UNIX, Zope will not detach from the controlling terminal.

   o Zope will print logging information to standard error.

   o The Z_DEBUG_MODE environment variable gets set, which causes some 
     other cool stuff in Zope to happen.

Using the Medusa Monitor

  If you're running ZServer with a medusa monitor port, you can
  connect and interact via a python prompt with a running Zope
  session, while others interact with it over the web.

  Some constraints:

   o You must connect to a server running on the local host.

   o You must authenticate as superuser.

   o At the time of writing the superuser password (in the access
     file) must be plain text, not encrypted.

  To use the monitor, start it from the shell prompt like so (as if
  from the Zope root):

  python ZServer/medusa/monitor_client.py localhost 8099

  You'll get back a python prompt.  To connect with the running Zope
  session:

  >>> import Zope
  >>> app = Zope.app()
  >>> dir(app.Control_Panel.Products)
  ['ExternalMethod', 'MIMETools', 'MailHost', 'OFSP', 'ZCatalog',
  'ZGadflyDA', 'ZSQLMethods', '_objects']
  >>> 

  To see ODB changes effected via the web since you got the app, you
  may have to do a bit of magic:

  >>> app._p_jar.sync()

  To commit changes you make, before exiting, you may have to do
  another bit of magic:

  >>> get_transaction().commit()
