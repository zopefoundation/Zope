  Zope 2.8.4 (2005/10/26)

    Bugs Fixed

      - Collector #1927:  Modified ZReST not to store rendered / warnings
        as persistent attributes, using volatile attributes instead as
        a cache.

      - Collector #1926: fixed a typo in _doAddUser when password
        encryption is enabled.

      - If a content object implemented any in-place numeric operators, 
        untrusted code could call them, thus modifying the content.

      - If Python 2.4 is used, despite the fact that Python 2.4 is
        unsupported, untrusted code could use generator expressions to
        gain access to container items.

  Zope 2.8.3 (2005/10/18)

    Other

      - ZSQLMethod.manage_main: Moved the error message that warns of a 
        non-existing or closed database connection next to the Connection ID
        dropdown and present it using red to increase its visibility.

      - Update to Docutils 0.3.9 (forgotten in Zope 2.8.2)

  Zope 2.8.2 (2005/10/13)

    Features added

      - Collector #1118: Added syntax to dtml-sqlgroup to support flexible
        generation of 'UPDATE' statements (bounty sponsored by Logicalware).

      - The '@' character is now allowed in object ids (RFC 1738 allows it).

    Bugs Fixed

      - OFS.Image.manage_FTPget() would str() it's .data attribute,
        potentially loading the whole file in memory as a
        string. Changed to use RESPONSE.write() iterating through the
        Pdata chain, just like index_html().

      - When PageTemplates have a syntax error, show the traceback output
        in the rendered error message.

      - Collector #1914: Hardened 'call_with_ns' (in
        'Products.PageTemplates.ZRPythonExpr') against namespaces from other
        callers than page templates.

      - Collector #1490: Added a new zope.conf option to control the
        character set used to encode unicode data that reaches
        ZPublisher without any specified encoding.

      - Collector #1895: omit 'var' folder from recursive traversal causing
        trouble with DirectoryStorage.

      - disabled ".. include" directive for all the ZReST product and the
        reStructuredText package

      - Collector #1888: Adjust call to 'engine.translate' to accomodate
        change in its signature.

      - Collector #1863: Prevent possibly sensitive information to leak via
        the TransientObject's __repr__ method.

      - Repaired 'handle_errors' usage for doctests, along with the
        supporting 'debug' argument passed to
        'ZPublisher.Test.publish_module'.

      - Collector #1879: applied patch by Dieter Maurer to fix a bug in
        ac_aquire() ignoring the default argument

      - Collector #1864, #1906: fixed header normalization in appendHeader()

      - Collector #1899: fixed migration issue when using export/import for
        ZCatalog instances

      - 'ZPublisher.Test.publish' now takes a 'done_string' argument, which
        is written to standard error when the request completes (forward
        ported from Zope 2.7 branch).

      - Collector #556:  <dtml-sqlvar> now returns 'null' instead of 'None'
        for values which are None in Python (sponsored by a bounty from
        Logicalware).

      - Collector #1182: BBB Forward port fix from 2.7 branch (19 months
        ago!), reverting 'guarded_getitem' to pass the 'index' argument as
        the name to 'validate'.  This change is *not* propagated to the
        trunk, because the resolution of #1182 specifies that the reverted
        behavior (i.e., passing None for item accces) is to become the
        standard implementation as of 2.9.

      - Collector #1877: skel/Products/README.txt inappropriately copied
        from CMF.

      - Collector #1871: Applied patch to support lists with records using
        ZTUtils.make_query()

      - AccessControl: creating a new user through "zpasswd inituser" did not
        work properly with a top-level user folder with enabled password
        encryption.

      - ZCatalog: refreshCatalog() could not be called safely from a ZEO
        client script

      - Catalog.clear(): fixed handling of _length attribute (caused import
        problems for some .zexp files e.g. Squishdot instances)

      - DateIndex now properly removes documents from both indexes if
        the value is None

      - Collector #1888: Some parts of the TALInterpreter would not pass a
        default when  translating, yet expect a string back. This would cause
        an error (usually "NoneType has no attribute 'replace'") in the case
        the message was not translated.

  Zope 2.8.1 (2005/08/11)

    Features added

      - Interface: Added Z3 -> Z2 bridge utilities.
        This allows to migrate interfaces to Zope 3 style interfaces and
        bridge them back to oldstyle interfaces for backwards compatibility.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Zope2.Startup.zopectl: fork before execv when running unit tests
        (don't exit the shell, if run from there).

      - TAL: MassageIDs are now handled the same way as in zope.tal.

      - DocumentTemplate: ustr no longer mangles MassageIDs.
        Custom string types are now returned unchanged.

      -  As developed in a long thread starting at
         http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2005-July/160433.html
         there appears to be a race bug in the Microsoft Windows socket
         implementation, rarely visible in ZEO and/or in
         ZServer/medusa/thread/select_trigger.py when multiple processes try
         to create an "asyncore trigger" simultaneously, most often (in
         stress tests) manifesting as a hung process.  Windows-specific
         trigger code in both changed to work around this bug when it occurs.

      - Collector #1807: fixed memory leak in cAccessControl.guarded_getattr()


  Zope 2.8.1 b1 (2005/07/28)

    Features Added

      - PluginIndexes, ZCTextIndex and ZCatalog: Added some z3 interfaces.

      - Verbose security exception reporting has been folded into Zope,
        removing the need for the VerboseSecurity product.  See the
        documentation for the "verbose-security" option in zope.conf.

      - "TemporaryStorage" (the storage that is used mainly to back the
        default sessioning database) is now MVCC capable, which essentially
        means that its usage will no longer generate ZODB ReadConflictErrors.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Collector #1852: fixed wrong URL construction in webdav.davcmds

      - Collector #1844: fixed whitespace handling in the ZMI "Find" tab

      - Collector #1813: removed spurious inclusion of CMFBTreeFolder.
        in Products/BTreeFolder2 (CMFCore will include it after 1.5, with
        an appropriate module alias for backward compatibility).

      - Replaced all transaction.commit(1) calls by  transaction.savepoint()

      - Collector #1832: UnIndex swallowed ConflictErrors.

      - Collector #1815: ZCTextIndex accepts (again) sequences of strings to
        be indexed.

      - Collector #1812: Fixed key error in ZSQL ZMI/Test

      - Fixed CMFBTreeFolder for CMF 1.5+

      - WebDAV COPY and MOVE did not call '_notifyOfCopyTo' and '_postCopy'
        hooks like it was done in OFS.CopySupport. Additionally added
        'manage_changeOwnershipType' to make MOVE behave even closer to
        OFS.CopySupport.

      - Collector #1548: Fix 'httplib' usage in ZPublisher.Client.

      - Collector #1808: manage_convertIndexes no longer tries to change the
        index types causing some trouble with CMF.

      - manage_convertIndexes did not treat DateRangeIndexes and PathIndexes
        properly.

      - Updated Zope X3 to bugfix release 3.0.1

      - Updated Five to bugfix release 1.0.2 (see Products/Five/CHANGES.txt)

  Zope 2.8.0 (2005/06/11)

    Bugs Fixed

      - Collector #1792: applied patch for broken ZClasses

      - doc/FAQ.txt updated: should bear some resemblance to reality now.
        (PCGI stuff removed; error information updated; PID information
        updated; upgrade procedure added; some common version questions added.)

      - Collector #1770: Fixed RestructuredText subtitle

      - Collector #1803: Fixed InitializeClass for some corner case.

      - Collector #1798, issue 1: ZopeTestCase no longer tries to
        install products that were installed by Zope during startup.

      - Collector #1799: Avoid lying about parent's refcount when
        calling back into Python code.

      - Collector #889:  made 'and' operator for KeywordIndexes actually
        restrict results as expected (thanks to 'aroda' for the patch!).

      - Collector #1323: applied patch to fix umask problem in zdctl

      - Updated Five to bugfix release 1.0.1 (see Products/Five/CHANGES.txt)

  Zope 2.8.0 b2 (2005/05/22)

    Features added

      - Made WebDAV server distinguishable from the default HTTP
        server both in the ZMI and in event.log.

      - Included BTreeFolder2

    Bugs fixed

      - Collector #1507/1728: Server addresses are now handled the same way on
        all platforms. This fixes the default binding on Windows.

      - Collector #1781: made 'create_mount_points' ZConfig option actually
        work (thanks to Dieter Maurer for the patch).

      - Collector #1780: DateTime.strftime() now handles dates <= 1900 or
        >= 2038

      - Collector #1775: turning off debug mode by default

      - Collector #1784: fixed handling of multiple attributes in ZCTextIndex

      - Don't copy '.svn' directories from skeleton into an instance
        (thanks to Dale Hirt for the patch).

      - Collector #1776: Improved setup.py.
        The Finder class is now used for the complete lib/python tree and has
        a blacklist instead of a whitelist for file extensions. So there
        should no longer be a need to update setup.py if modules or files are
        added or removed in lib/python.

      - Collector #1751: Improved error reporting reporting during the
        startup phase

      - Collector #1745: Fixed ZSQL error KeyError 'query'

      - Collector #1735: fixed UnicodeDecodeError in Loader.py

  Zope 2.8b1 (2005/04/24)

    Features added

      - Added lazy: TAL expression and fixed defer: expression for python
        expression

      - ZCatalog.CatalogBrains: An _unrestrictedGetObject method has
        been added.

      - ZODB transactions now support savepoints. See
        transaction/savepoint.txt.  These will replace
        subtransactions.

    Bugs fixed

      - Collector #1754: Fixed import of 'transaction' in
        'zopectl adduser' (which wasy dying with a NameError).

      - Collector #1750: StructuredText: fixed handling of image URLs
        with query string

      - Collector #1748: Fixed SIGSEGV in Acquisition

      - Hotfix_20050405:  classes defined in untrusted code could shadow
        the roles of methods defined as protected by their bases.

      - Collector #1656: Fixed enumeration within untrusted code
        (forward-port from 2.7 branch).

      - Collector #1721: Fixed handling of an empty indexed_attrs parameter


  Zope 2.8a2 (2005/04/02)

    Features added

      - ZCatalog.CatalogBrains:  'getObject' now raises errors, rather than
        returning None, in cases where the path points either to a nonexistent
        object (in which case it raises NotFound) or to one which the user
        cannot access (raising Unauthorized).  Sites which rely on the old
        behavior can restore setting a new zope.conf option,
        'catalog-getObject-raises', to "off".

        This compatibility option will be removed in Zope 2.10.

      - PluginIndexes: the ZCatalog's "Indexes" tab now show the number of
        distinct values indexed by each index instead of a mixture of indexed
        objects versus number of distinct values. Indexes derived from UnIndex
        show both values within their own ZMI screen. In addition most indexes
        have now a "Browse" tab to browse through the list of indexed
        values and their occurrences.

      - FTPServer: a RNFR (rename from) request is now being responded
        with a 550 error code if the source file does not exist

      - Fixed ObjectManager to not swallow exceptions during object
        deletion (in debug mode and if the user is not Manager). This
        allows for better debugging, while still keeping the possibility
        for a Manager to delete buggy objects.

      - Added a ZConfig directive 'large-file-threshold' to control
        the request content-size threshold at which a temporary file
        gets created. Use the same value for deciding between reading
        the whole request in memory or just a chunk inside
        webdav.NullResource.PUT().

      - RAMCacheManager: Allow invalidation of a cache entry from the
        Statistics view in the ZMI

      - Collector #1454/OFS.File: Accept content types ending with
        "javascript" as editable through the File edit form, just like
        text/<foo> types

      - Zope X3 3.0.0's 'src/zope' package is included now.

      - Five (Zope 3 integration technology for Zope 2) is included
        now in Products/Five.

    Bugs fixed

      - Collector #1460: guarded_apply was too restrictive.

      - OFS.Traversable still used a string 'NotFound' exception.

      - ZPublisher would fail to recognize a XML-RPC request if the
        content-type header included a 'charset' parameter.

      - Forward-ported 'aq_acquire'-related fix and associated tests
        from Zope 2.7.4.

      - Collector #1730: XML page templates couldn't call aq_parent in
        path expressions.

      - Fixed brain.getObject() to correctly traverse to an object even
        if one of its parents is not accessible, to be close to what the
        Publisher does.

      - Forward ported fix for OFS.CopySupport tests which corrected
        signature of a faux security policy's 'validate' method.

      - 'setup.py' did not install the 'Zope' compatibility module
        (the old 'Zope' package has been renamed to 'Zope2').

      - Fixed Shared.DC.ZRDB.Results to behave with the new-style
        ExtensionClass. Added a test.

      - 'setup.py' did not install the new 'Zope' compatibility module
        (the 'Zope' package has been renamedd to 'Zope2').

      - Collector #1507: Zope now binds again to all available IP addresses if
        ip-address is unset

      - Use 'del' instead of 'list.remove()' in
        Catalog.delColumn(). There can be only one column with the
        same name, and it could potentially break catalog metadata as
        remove() may remove more than one element from the list if
        they have the same value. Also, we already have the list index
        we are interested in deleting so it doesn't make sense to look
        up the value and call 'list.remove()' on it.

      - Collector #1628: FTP server has been broken (directory
        listings did not work)

      - Collector #1705: CopySource._postCopy is never called

      - Collector #1617: Fixed crash in ZPT code (caused by improper
        checks in cAccessControl)

      - Collector #1683: fixing batching in the DA "Test" tab

      - Collector #1648: Fix bug in Medusa FTP

      - Collector #1667: allow 'max-number-of-session-objects 0' to have
        the same effect as setting the value via the web interface (i.e.,
        make the number of session objects unlimited, rather than falling
        back to the default).

      - Collector: #1651: removed compiler warning

      - Collector #1661: make 'python-check-interval' setting in zope.conf
        actually work as documented.  This setting allows for important
        tuning opportunities for production Zope servers.

      - Collector #1657:  Don't break host-based virtual hosting when
        purging an HTTP accelerator.

      - DTML Methods were not interoperable with the new filestream_iterator
        and caches based on it (FileCacheManager).

      - Collector #1655: fixed severe memory leak in TemporaryStorage

      - Collector #1407: fixed XML escaping problem introduced in 2.7.4 b1

      - Collector #1151: HTTP compression was broken on error pages

      - The REQUEST now contains a new entry ACTUAL_URL which contains the
        full URL without query string as it appears within the location bar of
        the browser. The key has been added to provide a single key that is
        available for vhosted and non-vhosted installations.

      - Collector #1605: VHM did not quote URLs

      - webdav.Resource: during COPY, manage_afterClone was called way
        too early, thus the object wasn't bound to the database and
        couldn't find a context. Changed to behave the same way as
        CopySupport.

      - RAMCacheManager: opimized performance by using cPickle instead
        of pickle and by using the highest pickle protocol available
        instead of using ASCII pickles (patch by Dieter Maurer)

      - Collector #631: Image URLs in StructuredText containing port
        numbers were not rendered correctly

      - Collector #1498: Don't choke on malformed cookies. Cookies of
        the form "foo=bar; hmm; baz=gee" will give an empty value for
        'hmm' instead of silently discarding it and the rest of the
        string. (Thanks to 'sirilyan' for the patch.)

      - bin/zopectl test now uses os.execv, instead os os.system,
        so that options with characters that needs shell quoting
        doesn't break the command.

      - Collector #1219:  Make XML export sane again.

      - Collector #945:  Allow adding empty PythonScript instances
        programmatically.

      - Updated doc/UNITTEST.txt and lib/python/Testing/README.txt to
        reflect progress made since UNITTEST.txt was originally written.

      - Removed Version objects from the add menu. Versions are agreed to be a
        feature that should not be used as it is not well implemented and
        allows for data loss.

      - Collector #1510: Allow encoding of application/xhtml+xml pages
        according to the charset specified in the Content-Type header
        (thanks to Jacek Konieczny for the patch).

      - Collector #1599: made sqltest work with unicode strings (thanks
        to Peter Sabaini for the patch).

      - zopectl: fixed handling of child processes (patch by Dieter Maurer)

      - Collector #1593: fixed dumb _get_id() implementation in
        OFS.CopySupport that produced copy_of_copy_of....files (thanks
        to Alexandre Boeglin for the patch).

      - Collector #1450: files in utilities/ZODBTools are now installed
        during the installation process in the 'bin' directory

      - Collector #1003: added new 'http-header-max-length' directive
        to zope.conf to specific the maximum length of a HTTP request
        header before it is considered as a possible DoS attack and
        discarded.

      - Collector #1371: added new 'cgi-maxlen' directive to zope.conf
        to limit the amount of form data being processed by Zope
        to prevent DoS attacks

      - Collector #1407: changed WebDAV display name for objects
        to title_or_id()

      - the 'trusted-proxy' directive in zope.conf now also accepts
        hostnames instead of IP addresses only (patch by Dieter Maurer)

      - Fixed test.py to not over-resolve symbolic links. Needed to run
        tests when the Products directory and a product are symlinks.

      - Collector #1583/ZReST: Fixed handling of the title attribute
        for non-ascii characters.

      - Collector #1577: Fixed cryptic error message in ZPublisher if a
        non-ASCII string is passed to a date, int, long or float property.

      - Collector #1576: Fixed Z Search Interface to use proper HTML.

      - Collector #1127: strftime did not take timezone into account.

      - Collector #1569/DateTime: Added a new ISO8601-method that will
        return correctly formatted ISO 8601-representations to augment
        the ISO method which isn't compliant with ISO 8601.

      - ZPublisher: changed some hardcoded 'latin1' arguments to 'iso-8859-15'
        since latin1 is obsolete.

      - Collector #1566: Installation of Zope on some older Solaris versions
        could fail due to a broken "echo" implementation causing the
        creation of a borked version.txt file.

      - Collector #934: Image and File objects are now always internally
        split into small chunks even when initialized from a string.

      - docutils: updated to V 0.3.5. The Zope core now contains a full copy of
        the docutils package except some GPLed files which can not be included
        with the Zope distribution due to license constraints on svn.zope.org.

      - docutils: moved from lib/python/docutils to
        lib/python/third_party/docutils

      - Collector #1557/OFS.Image: Introducing new 'alt' property. The 'alt'
        attribute is no longer taken from the 'title' property but from the new
        'alt' property.  The border="0" attribute is no longer part of the HTML
        output except specified otherwise.

      - Set a default value of '' for the new 'alt' property as not to
        break existing content.

      - Collector #1511: made IPCServer show up in the Control Panel under
        "Network Services"

      - Collector #1443: Applied patch by Simon Eisenmann that reimplements
        the XML parser used in WebDAV fixing a memory leak.

      - Always unescape element contents on webdav.xmltools

      - Use saxutils to escape/unescape values for/from
        PROPFIND/PROPPATCH.

      - Make OFS.PropertySheet use the escaping function from
        webdav.xmltools.

      - Escape/unescape &quot; and &apos;

      - Don't escape properties stored as XML (ie: having a
        __xml_attrs__ metadata set by PROPPATCH) when building a
        PROPFIND response.

      - If a PROPPATCH element value contains only a CDATA section,
        store the CDATA contents only.

      - Catch AttributeErrors and KeyErrors raised from
        __bobo_traverse__ and convert them to NotFound. In debug mode
        a more verbose error message is issued, the same way it's done
        on attribute/item traversal.

      - Collector #1523: replace the text field for importing .zexp/.xml
        files with a selection list

      - Stitch newly-created object into it's container *before*
        calling it's PUT() method. This fixes an issue with
        OFS.File/OFS.Image that would result into reading the whole
        file in memory and wrapping it into a *single* Pdata object.

      - Import ZServer.CONNECTION_LIMIT variable *inside* the method
        that uses it. Before this, the variable was imported at the
        module level, thus binding it too early which would cause the
        ZConfig handler to have no real effect.

  Zope 2.8a1 (2004/10/17)

    Features added

     - Included Stefan Holek's ZopeTestCase 0.9

     - The SiteErrorLog allows you to acknowledge (or delete) exceptions,
       so you can reduce or clear the list without restarting your
       Zope server. Additionally the SiteErrorLog is covered by unit tests
       now.

     - Unit tests added for the SiteErrorLog.

     - UI improvement for the ZCatalog. The "catalog contents" allow
       you to filter the cataloged objects by path now.

     - Made test.py follow symbolic links on POSIX systems.

     - added utilities/reindex_catalog.py to perform ZCatalog maintenance
       operations from the command line (through zopectl)

     - RESPONSE.setBody and RESPONSE.setStatus now accept lock
       parameters in the same way as RESPONSE.redirect. These prevent
       further calls to the methods from overwriting the previous value.
       This is useful when writing http proxies.

     - DateTime: new DateTime instance can be constructed from a given
       DateTime instance: d_new = DateTime(d_old)

     - The DateTime parser now throws a SyntaxError upon any parsing errors.

     - ZCatalog: added a new configuration option in the "Advanced" tab
       to provide optional logging of the progress of long running
       reindexing or recataloging operations.

     - made Zope.configure return the starter instance to enable other
       methods to be called, such as starter.setupConfiguredLoggers()

     - Improved Unicode handling in Page Templates. Template contents
       and title will now be saved as a Unicode string if
       the management_page_charset variable can be acquired and is true.
       The character set of an uploaded file can now be specified.

     - zopectl now accepts the -m argument to set a umask for files created
       by the managed process (e.g. -m 002 or --umask 002).

     - AccessControl/permission_settings() now has a new optional parameter
       'permission' to retrieve the permission settings for a particular
       permission.

     - The obsolete 'SearchIndex' package has been removed

     - Traversal now supports a "post traversal hook" that get's run
       after traversal finished and the security context is established.

     - Using "_usage" parameters in a ZCatalog query is deprecated and
       logged as DeprecationWarning.

     - MailHost now has two additional properties, a user id and a
       password. These are used to attempt ESMTP authentication
       before sending a mail.

     - Folder listings in FTP now include "." as well as "..".

     - When a VHM is activated, it adds the mapping
       'VIRTUAL_URL_PARTS': (SERVER_URL, BASEPATH1, virtual_url_path)
       to the request's 'other' dictionary.  If BASEPATH1 is empty, it
       is omitted from the tuple.  The joined parts are also added
       under the key 'VIRTUAL_URL'.  Since the parts are evaluated
       before traversal continues, they will not reflect modifications
       to the path during traversal or by the addition of a default
       method such as 'index_html'.

     - Extension Classes, a key Zope foundation, have been totally
       rewritten based on Python new-style classes.

       This change provides a number of advantages:

       o Use of new-style class features (e.g. slots, descriptors,
         etc.) in Zope objects. Support for object protocols (special
         __ methods) added since Python 1.4.

       o Support for cyclic garbage collection.

       o Ability to use new-style classes as base classes of Zope objects.

       o Pave the way for sharing code between Zope 2 and Zope 3.

       Note -- Extension classes with __of__ methods are made into
         Python read descriptors.

         If an extension classes is used to implement a descriptor,
         indirectly by implementing __of__ or directly by implementing
         __get__, the behavior of the descriptor will differ from
         ordinary descriptors in an important way. The descriptors
         __get__ method will be called *even if* the descriptor is
         stored on an instance of an extension class.  Normally
         descritor __get__ methods are called only of the descriptor
         is stored in a class.

     - ZODB 3.3

       This is the first version of ZODB that does not require
       ExtensionClass.

     - Add 'parity' method to ZTUtils Iterators.

     - Allow untrusted code to mutate ZPublisher record objects.

     - Added a "mime-types" configuration value which names a file
       giving additional MIME type to filename extension mappings.
       The "mime-types" setting may be given more than once in the
       configuration file; the files have the same format at the
       mime.types file distributed with Apache.

     - Changed the ZEO server and control process to work with a
       single configuration file; this is now the default way to
       configure these processes.  (It's still possible to use
       separate configuration files.)  The ZEO configuration file can
       now include a "runner" section used by the control process and
       ignored by the ZEO server process itself.  If present, the
       control process can use the same configuration file.

     - ZConfig was updated to version 2.0.  The new version includes
       two new ways to perform schema extension; of particular
       interest in Zope is the ability for a configuration file to
       "import" new schema components to allow 3rd-party components
       (such as storages, databases, or logging handlers) to be used.

     - The testrunner.py script has been replaced with test.py which
       is now installed into the 'bin' folder.

    Bugs fixed

     - Removed Python 2.3.3 as valid option. ZODB 3.3 requires Python
       2.3.4 or later.

     - Collector #1332: Added in-place migration of the Catalog.__len__
       attribute to avoid new-style class caching problems. Instances of
       ZCatalog or instances of classes with ZCatalog as base class will be
       migrated automatically. Instances of Catalog or classes with Catalog
       as base class must be migrated manually by calling the migrate__len__()
       method on the every instance. In addition old BTree migration code
       (for pre-Zope 2.5 instances) has been removed. If you want to migrate
       from such an old version to Zope 2.8, you need to clear and reindex
       your ZCatalog).

     - Collector #1595: same as in Collector #1132 for indexes derived from
       UnIndex. Exisiting ZCatalog instances must be converted manually
       by calling the "manage_convertIndexes" method through-the-web for
       every single ZCatalog instance. See also doc/FAQ.txt (Installation,
       question #4)

     - Collector #1457: ZCTextIndex's QueryError and ParseError
       are now available for import from untrusted code.

     - Collector #1473: zpasswd.py can now accept --username
       without --password

     - Collector #1491: talgettext.py did not create a proper header
       for the generated .pot file if multiple pagetemplate files
       were processed.

     - Collector #1477: TaintedString.strip() now implements the
       same signature as str.strip()

     - TAL: tal:on-error does not trap ConflictError anymore.

     - OFS.CopySupport: Enforced "Delete objects" permission during
       move (CMF Collector #259).

     - Removed DWIM'y attempt to filter acquired-but-not-aceessible
       results from 'guarded_getattr'.

     - Collector #1267: applied patch to fix segmentation faults on
       x86_64 systems

     - ZReST: the charset used in the rendered HTML was not set to the
       corresponding output_encoding property of the ZReST instance. In addition
       changing the encodings through the Properties tab did not re-render
       the HTML.

     - Collector #1234: an exception triple passed to LOG() was not
       propagated properly to the logging module of Python

     - Collector #1441: Removed headers introduced to make Microsoft
       webfolders and office apps happy, since they make a lot of
       standards-compliant things unhappy AND they trick MS Office
       into trying to edit office files stored in Zope via WebDAV even
       when the user isn't allowed to edit them and is only trying to
       download them.

     - Collector #1445: Fixed bad interaction between -p and -v(v)
       options to test.py that resulted in exceptions being printed
       when they shouldn't have been.

     - Collector #729: manage_main doesn't display the correct page title
       most of the time. It is not completely fixed but using title_or_id
       makes folders display the correct id as a fallback.

     - Collector #1370: Fixed html generated by Z Search interface.

     - Collector #1295: Fixed minor niglet with the Elvis tutorial.

     - added "version.txt" to setup.py to avoid untrue "unreleased version"
       messages within the control panel

     - Collector #1436: applied patch to fix a memory leak in
       cAccessControl.

     - Collector #1431: fixed NetBSD support in initgroups.c

     - Collector #1406: fixed segmentation fault by acquisition

     - Collector #1392: ExternalMethod ignored management_page_charset

     - unrestrictedTraverse() refactored to remove hasattr calls (which mask
       conflict errors) and for greater readability and maintainability.

     - Zope can now be embedded in C/C++ without exceptions being raised
       in zdoptions.

     - Collector #1213: Fixed wrong labels of cache parameters

     - Collector #1265: Fixed handling of orphans in ZTUtil.Batch

     - Collector #1293: missing 'address' parameters within one of the server
       sections raise an exception.

     - Collector #1345: AcceleratedHTTPCacheManager now sends the
       Last-Modified header.

     - Collector #1126: ZPublisher.Converters.field2lines now using
       splitlines() instead of split('\n').

     - Collector #1322: fixed HTML quoting problem with ZSQL methods
       in DA.py

     - Collector #1124: The ZReST product now uses the same reST encoding
       parameters from zope.conf as the low-level reStructuredText
       implementation.

     - Collector #1259: removed the "uninstall" target from the Makefile
       since the uninstall routine could also remove non-Zope files. Because
       this was to dangerous it has been removed completely.

     - Collector #1299: Fixed bug in sequence.sort()

     - Collector #1159: Added test for __MACH__ to initgroups.c so the
       initgroups method becomes available on Mac OS X.

     - Collector #1004: text,token properties were missing in
       PropertyManager management page.

     - Display index name on error message when index can't be used as
       'sort_on'.

     - PUT would fail if the created object had a __len__ = 0 (eg:
       BTreeFolder2) and fallback to _default_put_factory. Fix by
       checking if the returned object is None instead.

     - Collector #1160: HTTPResponse.expireCookie() potentially didn't
       when an 'expires' keyword argument was passed.

     - Collector #1289: Allow ZSQL methods to be edited via WebDAV.

     - WebDAV property values were not being properly escaped on
       'propstat'.

     - WebDAV 'supportedlock' was not checking if the object did
       implement the WriteLockInterface before returning it's
       value.

     - reStructuredText ignored the encoding settings in zope.conf

     - ObjectManager no longer raises string exceptions

     - Collector #1260: Testing/__init__.py no longer changes the
       INSTANCE_HOME.

     - App.config.setConfiguration() did not update the legacy source
       for debug_mode, Globals.DevelopmentMode.

     - Script (Python) objects now have a _filepath attribute, also
       used as the '__file__' global at runtime.  This prevents an
       import problem caused by the fix to #1074.

     - Minor usability tweaks:

       * Increased FindSupport meta type selection widgets
         height to 8 lines

     - The DateTime module did not recognize the settings for
       "datetime-format".

     - Stop testrunner.py from recursing into the 'build-base' directory
       created by setup.py.

     - Collector #1074: Change Scripts' __name__ to None

     - Range searches with KeywordIndexes did not work with record-style
       query parameters

     - Item_w__name__ now has a working getId() method

     - PageTemplateFile now using Item_w__name__ mixin, fixing
       its getId() and absolute_url() methods.

     - Only one VirtualHostMonster is allowed per container.

     - Collector #1133: TreeTag choked on Ids of type long.

     - Collector #1012: A carefully crafted compressed tree state
       could violate size limit.  Limit is no longer hardcoded.

     - Collector #1139: tal:attributes didn't escape double quotes.

     - Management interface of TopicIndexes has been completely broken

     - Collector #1129: Improper parsing of ISO8601 in DateTime.

     - Removed pervasive use of string exceptions (some may still be
       hiding in the woodwork, but all raise's with string literals are
       gone).

     - AccessControl.User used a misleading string exeception,
       'NotImplemented', which shadowed the Python builtin.

     - Collector #426: Inconsistent, undocumented error() method.

     - Collector #799: Eliminate improper uses of SCRIPT_NAME.

     - Collector #445: Add internal global declaration for Script bindings.

     - Collector #616: Make CONTEXTS available to TALES Python expressions.

     - Collector #1074: Give Script execution context a __name__

     - Collector #1095: Allow TAL paths starting with '/varname' as a
       preferred spelling for 'CONTEXTS/varname'.

     - Collector #391: Cut and paste now requires delete permissions.

     - Collector #331: Referenses to URL in manage_tabs was changed
       to REQUEST.URL to prevent accidental overriding.

     - Made the control panel properly reflect the cache-size setting
       of ZODB's object cache once again.

     - ConflictError was swallowed in ObjectManager by
       manage_beforeDelete and _delObject. This could break code
       expecting to do cleanups before deletion.

     - Python 2.3 BooleanType wasn't handled properly by ZTUtils
       marshalling and ZPublisher's converters.

     - Collector #1065: bin/ scripts didn't export HOME envars.

     - Collector #572: WebDAV GET protected by 'FTP Access' permission.
       Two new methods have been added to WebDAV resources, "manage_DAVget"
       and "listDAVObjects". These are now used by WebDAV instead of the
       earlier "manage_FTPget" and "objectValues". This separates the
       permissions, and allows WebDAV specific overriding of these methods.

     - Collector #904: Platform specific signals in zdaemon/Daemon.py
       (fixed by removing the "fossil" module from 2.7 branch and head).

     - Workaround for Collector #1081: The 'title' property for objects
       derived from OFS.Folder or PropertyManager can now be
       removed and replaced with a ustring property. This allows the usage
       of non-ISO-8859-1 or ASCII charsets

     - Collector #951: DateTime(None) is now equal to DateTime()

     - Collector #1056: aq_acquire() ignored the default argument

     - Collector #1087: ZPT: "repeat/item/length" did not work as documented
       in the Zope Book.

     - Collector #721: Entities in tal:attribute values weren't
       properly escaped.

     - Collector #851: Traversable.py: A bare try..except shadowed
       conflict errors

     - Collector #1058: Several fixes for PropertySheets when used
       outside ZClasses

     - Collector #1053: parseIndexRequest turned empty sequence of search
       terms into unrestricted search.

     - manage_tabs had a namespace problem with the acquisition of names from
       the manage_options variable resulting to acquire "target" and "action"
       from objects above in the hierachy.

     - PathIndex and TopicIndex are now using a counter for the number
       of indexed objects instead of using a very expensive calculation
       based on the keys of their indexes.

     - Collector #1039: Whitespace problem in Z2.log fixed

     - changed some bare try: except:'s in Shared.DC.ZRDB.Connection
       so that they now log exceptions that occur.

     - ObjectManager will now attempt to set Owner local role keyed
       to the user's id, rather than username.
