  "python wo_pcgi.py" doesn't build the extensions correctly due to
  linking problems.  To fix it, I just SymLinked ld_so_aix, makexp_aix
  and python.exp (found in <python-build>/Modules/) into each of the
  dirs in <Zope-build>/python/lib that contain .c files... and it
  worked just great. But I'm sure it's not the best solution

from Wolfgang Roesner (reporting segfaults and a fix)

  The default stack size for a pthread on AIX (at least in my
  configuration) is 96kB. On Solaris it's 1M. As soon as I explicitly
  set the initial stack size to 1M the problem went away and it
  appears as if Zope is up and running.

  Unfortunately I really had to change "thread_pthread.h" in Python
  which obviously is not a nice thing to do as I now have a need for
  my own private version of Python. But at least I have a running
  version of Zope on AIX.
