Credits

  The Zope software receives contributions from far and wide.  Here's
  the Zope Hall of Fame:

    o Stephen Purcell allows us to distribute his PyUnit unit testing
      framework with Zope.

    o Jeff Bauer is Zope Dude Number One.  Jeff took over PCGI and
      kept pushing it forward through the years.

    o Sam Rushing worked with us at Digital Creations to make Medusa
      the publishing platform for ZServer and the concurrency of Zope2.

    o A subset of windows guru Mark Hammond's win32 extensions are
      bundled with win32 binary distributions of Zope.

    o Martijn Pieters and Brian Hooper contributed the #in reverse
      attribute.

    o Phillip Eby contributed the DTML 'let' tag and many
      other useful ideas, including the inspiration for the DTML
      'call', 'with' and 'return'
      tags.

    o The DateTime module was based on work from Ted Horst.

    o Jordan Baker contributed the 'try' tag, something we've wanted
      for a long, long time.

    o Martijn Pieters chipped in with a safe range function.

    o Michael Hauser came up with the name "Zope".

    o Eric Kidd from Userland contributed to ZPublisher's support for
      XML-RPC.

    o Andrew M. Kuchling wrote the initial version of mod_pcgi, making 
      him extremely cool in our book.

    o Oleg Broytmann has taken up the standard of mod_pcgi and moving
      it to be a really amazing thing, and ready for prime time.

    o Jephte CLAIN made some patches to European ZopeTime.

    o Thanks to Gregor Hoffleit for his work in getting Zope into the
      Debian distribution.

    o All the other Zopistas far and wide that stuck with us during
      the Bobo/Principia days and politely push us to make the best damn
      app server on this or any other planet.

    o Of course the list of credits would be quite incomplete without
      mentioning Guido van Rossum, benevolent dictator of Python and
      long-time friend of Digital Creations.  Zope Power is Python
      Power.

    o Special thanks to Richard Stallman and the Free Software
      Foundation for their assistance and feedback on the
      GPL-compatible 2.0 version of the Zope Public License.
