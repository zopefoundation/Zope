    Version 1.4.0

      Features Added

        - Added TAL statement: omit_tag="[<boolean expr>]" replaces
          the statement tag with its contents if the boolean
          expression is true or omitted.

        - The TAL and METAL namespaces can be applied to tag names,
          tags in these namespaces are removed from rendered output
          (leaving the contents in place, as with omit_tag)
          whenever attributes in these namespaces would be, and
          tag attributes without explicit namespaces default to the
          tag's namespace (per XML spec).

    Version 1.3.3

      Bugs Fixed

        - tal:atributes was creating stray attributes in METAL
          expansion, and there was no unit test for this behavior.

        - tal:attributes parsing was not catching badly malformed
          values, and used "print" instead of raising exceptions.

        - Improved execution performance

      Bug Fixed
