Most of the files included in this project have been placed in the
public domain, and therefore have no license requirements and no
restrictions on copying or usage; see the `Public Domain Dedication`_
below.  There are a few exceptions_, listed below.

One goal of the Docutils project is to be included in the Python
standard library distribution, at which time it is expected that
copyright will be asserted by the `Python Software Foundation
<http://www.python.org/psf/>`_.


Public Domain Dedication
========================

The persons who have associated their work with this project (the
"Dedicator": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils
project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less the exceptions_
listed below, in the work of authorship known as "Docutils" identified
below (the "Work") to the public domain.

The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web
site <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>.  The Work consists of the
files within the "docutils" module of the Docutils project CVS
repository (Internet host cvs.sourceforge.net, filesystem path
/cvsroot/docutils), whose Internet web interface is located at
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/docutils/docutils/>.
Files dedicated to the public domain may be identified by the
inclusion, near the beginning of each file, of a declaration of the
form::

    Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been
               placed in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large
and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors.  Dedicator
intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in
perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law,
whether vested or contingent, in the Work.  Dedicator understands that
such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all
rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods
that have not yet been invented or conceived.

(Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.)  The BSD license and the Python

by multiple owners and lots of legalese, the Python license basically
lets you copy, use, modify, and redistribute files as long as you keep
the copyright attribution intact, note any changes you make, and don't
use the owner's name in vain.  The BSD license is similar.
