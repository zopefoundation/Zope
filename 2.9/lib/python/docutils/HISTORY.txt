Release 0.3.5 (2004-07-29)
==========================

General:

* _`Documentation cleanup/reorganization`.

    * ``docs/user/``: introductory/tutorial material for end-users
    * ``docs/dev/``: for core-developers (development notes, plans, etc.)
    * ``docs/api/``: API reference material for client-developers
    * ``docs/ref/``: reference material for all groups
    * ``docs/howto/``: for component-developers and core-developers
    * ``docs/peps/``: Python Enhancement Proposals

  - Moved ``docs/*`` to ``docs/user/``.
  - Moved ``pysource.dtd``, ``pysource.txt``, ``semantics.txt`` from
    ``spec/`` to ``docs/dev``.
  - Moved ``doctree.txt``, ``docutils.dtd``, ``soextblx.dtd``,

  - Moved ``reStructuredText.txt``, ``directives.txt``,
    ``interpreted.txt``, and ``introduction.txt`` from ``spec/rst/``
    to ``docs/ref/rst/``.  Renamed ``interpreted.txt`` to
    ``roles.txt``, ``reStructuredText.txt`` to
    ``restructuredtext.txt``.
  - Moved ``spec/howto/`` to ``docs/howto``.

  In order to keep the CVS history of moved files, we supplied
  SourceForge with a `script for modifying the Docutils CVS
  repository`__.

  __ http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/docutils/sandbox/davidg/infrastructure/cvs-reorg.sh?content-type=text/plain&rev=1.5

  After running the cleanup script:

  - Added ``docs/index.txt``.
  - Added a ``.htaccess`` file to the ``web`` module, containing
    redirects for all old paths to new paths.  They'll preserve
    fragments (the "#name" part of a URL), and won't clutter up the
    file system, and will correct the URL in the user's browser.
  - Added ``BUGS.txt``, ``docs/dev/policies.txt``,
    ``docs/dev/website.txt``, ``docs/dev/release.txt`` from all but
    the "To Do" list itself in ``docs/dev/todo.txt``.
  - Moved "Future Plans" from ``HISTORY.txt`` to new "Priorities"
    section of ``docs/dev/todo.txt``.
  - Added ``THANKS.txt`` from "Acknowledgements" in ``HISTORY.txt``.
  - Added "How To Report Bugs" to ``BUGS.txt``.
  - Went through all the sources and docs (including under web/) and
    updated links.  Mostly done by Felix Wiemann; thanks Felix!

    publish_parts, into new publish_programmatically.  Extracted
    settings code to ``Publisher.process_programmatic_settings``.
  - In Publisher.publish, disabled ``settings_overrides`` when
    ``settings`` is supplied; redundant.

* docutils/frontend.py:

  - Added help text for "--output-encoding-error-handler" and
    "--error-encoding-error-handler".

    Cherniavsky.
  - Refactored explicit target processing code.
  - Added name attribute to references containing the reference name only
    through whitespace_normalize_name (no case changes).
  - parse_target no longer returns the refname after going through
    normalize_name. This is now handled in make_target.

    problems on SourceForge (``libssl.so.2`` unavailable?).
  - Added the "role" directive for declaring custom interpreted text
    roles.

* docutils/parsers/rst/directives/parts.py:

  - The "contents" directive does more work up-front, creating the
    "topic" and "title", and leaving the "pending" node for the
    transform.  Allows earlier reference resolution; fixes subtle bug.

* docutils/parsers/rst/languages/af.py: Added to project; Afrikaans
  mappings by Jannie Hofmeyr.

* docutils/parsers/rst/languages/cs.py: Added to project; Czech
  mappings by Marek Blaha.

  mappings by Roman Suzi.

* docutils/transforms/parts.py:

  - The "contents" directive does more work up-front, creating the

    transform.  Allows earlier reference resolution; fixes subtle bug.
  - Added support for disabling of section numbering.
    
* docutils/transforms/references.py:

  - Verifying that external targets are truly targets and not indirect 
    references. This is because we are now adding a "name" attribute to 
    references in addition to targets. Note sure if this is correct!
  - Added code to hook into the unknown_reference_resolvers list for a
    transformer in resolve_indirect_target. This allows the
    unknown_reference_resolvers to keep around indirect targets which
    docutils doesn't know about.
  - Added specific error message for duplicate targets.

* docutils/transforms/universal.py:

  - Added FilterMessages transform (removes system messages below the
    verbosity threshold).
  - Added hook (via docutils.TransformSpec.unknown_reference_resolvers)
    to FinalCheckVisitor for application-specific handling of 
    unresolvable references.
  - Added specific error message for duplicate targets.
  
* docutils/writers/__init__.py:

  - Added assemble_parts method to the Writer class to allow for
    access to a documents individual parts.
  - Documented & set default for ``Writer.output`` attribute.

* docutils/writers/html4css1.py:

  - Fixed unicode handling of attribute values (bug 760673).
  - Prevent duplication of "class" attribute values (bug report from
    Kirill Lapshin).
  - Improved table grid/border handling (prompted by report from Bob
    Marshall).
  - Added support for table titles.
  - Added "<title />" for untitled docs, for XHTML conformance; thanks
    to Darek Suchojad.
  - Added functionality to keep track of individual parts of a document
    and store them in a dictionary as the "parts" attribute of the writer.
    Contributed by Reggie Dugard at the Docutils sprint at PyCon DC 2004.
  - Added proper support for the "scale" attribute of the "image"
    element.  Contributed by Brent Cook.
  - Added ``--initial-header-level`` option.
  - Fixed bug: the body_pre_docinfo segment depended on there being a
    docinfo; if no docinfo, the document title was incorporated into
    the body segment.  Adversely affected the publish_parts interface.

* docutils/writers/latex2e.py:

  - Changed default stylesheet to "no stylesheet" to avoid latex complaining
    about a missing file.
  - Added options and support: ``--compound-enumerators``,
    ``--section-prefix-for-enumerators``, and
    ``--section-enumerator-separator``.  By John F Meinel Jr (SF patch
    934322).
  - Added option ``--use-verbatim-when-possible``, to avoid
    problematic characters (eg, '~' in italian) in literal blocks.
  - It's now possible to use four section levels in the `book` and
    `report` LaTeX classes.  The default `article` class still has
    three levels limit.

  Moved config file entry descriptions from tools.txt.

* docs/tools.txt:

  - Moved config file entry descriptions to config.txt.

  - Added description of support for <angle-bracketed> complex option
    arguments to option lists.
  - Added subsections for indented and quoted literal blocks.

* test: Continually adding & updating tests.

  - Added test/test_settings.py & test/data/config_*.txt support
    files.
  - Added test/test_writers/test_htmlfragment.py.

* test/DocutilsTestSupport.py:

  - Refactored LaTeX publisher test suite/case class names to make
    testing other writers easier.
  - Added HtmlWriterPublishTestCase and HtmlFragmentTestSuite classes
    to test the processing of HTML fragments which use the new
    publish_parts convenience function.

* tools/buildhtml.py:

  - Added support for the "--prune" option.
  - Removed dependency on pep2html.py; plaintext PEPs no longer
    supported.

* tools/docutils.conf:

  - Updated for configuration file reorganization.

* tools/rst2html.py:

  - copied from tools/html.py

* setup.py:

  - added a 'scripts' section to configuration

Release 0.2 (2002-07-31)
========================

General:

- The word "component" was being used ambiguously.  From now on,
  "component" will be used to mean "Docutils component", as in Reader,
  Writer, Parser, or Transform.  Portions of documents (Table of
  Contents, sections, etc.)  will be called "document parts".
- Did a grand renaming: a lot of ``verylongnames`` became
  ``very_long_names``.
- Cleaned up imports: no more relative package imports or
  comma-separated lists of top-level modules.
- Added support for an option values object which carries default
  settings and overrides (from command-line options and library use).
- Added internal Unicode support, and support for both input and
  output encodings.
- Added support for the ``docutils.io.IO`` class & subclasses.

Specific:

* docutils/__init__.py:

  - Added ``ApplicationError`` and ``DataError``, for use throughout
    the package.
  - Added ``Component`` base class for Docutils components; implements
    the ``supports`` method.
  - Added ``__version__`` (thus, ``docutils.__version__``).

* docutils/core.py:

  - Removed many keyword parameters to ``Publisher.__init__()`` and
    ``publish()``; bundled into an option values object.  Added
    "argv", "usage", "description", and "option_spec" parameters for
    command-line support.
  - Added ``Publisher.process_command_line()`` and ``.set_options()``
    methods.
  - Reworked I/O model for ``docutils.io`` wrappers.
  - Updated ``Publisher.set_options()``; now returns option values
    object.
  - Added support for configuration files (/etc/docutils.conf,
    ./docutils.conf, ~/.docutils).
  - Added ``Publisher.setup_option_parser()``.
  - Added default usage message and description.

* docutils/frontend.py: Added to project; support for front-end
  (command-line) scripts.  Option specifications may be augmented by
  components.  Requires Optik (http://optik.sf.net/) for option
  processing (installed locally as docutils/optik.py).

* docutils/io.py: Added to project; uniform API for a variety of input
  output mechanisms.

* docutils/nodes.py:

  - Added ``TreeCopyVisitor`` class.
  - Added a ``copy`` method to ``Node`` and subclasses.
  - Added a ``SkipDeparture`` exception for visitors.
  - Renamed ``TreePruningException`` from ``VisitorException``.
  - Added docstrings to ``TreePruningException``, subclasses, and
    ``Nodes.walk()``.
  - Improved docstrings.
  - Added ``SparseNodeVisitor``, refined ``NodeVisitor``.
  - Moved ``utils.id()`` to ``nodes.make_id()`` to avoid circular
    imports.
  - Added ``decoration``, ``header``, and ``footer`` node classes, and
    ``PreDecorative`` mixin.
  - Reworked the name/id bookkeeping; to ``document``, removed
    ``explicit_targets`` and ``implicit_targets`` attributes, added
    ``nametypes`` attribute and ``set_name_id_map`` method.
  - Added ``NodeFound`` exception, for use with ``NodeVisitor``
    traversals.
  - Added ``document.has_name()`` method.
  - Fixed DOM generation for list-attributes.
  - Added category class ``Labeled`` (used by footnotes & citations).
  - Added ``Element.set_class()`` method (sets "class" attribute).

* docutils/optik.py: Added to project.  Combined from the Optik
  package, with added option groups and other modifications.  The use
  of this module is probably only temporary.

* docutils/statemachine.py:

  - Added ``runtime_init`` method to ``StateMachine`` and ``State``.
  - Added underscores to improve many awkward names.
  - In ``string2lines()``, changed whitespace normalizing translation
    table to regexp; restores Python 2.0 compatibility with Unicode.

* docutils/urischemes.py:
