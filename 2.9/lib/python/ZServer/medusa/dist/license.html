    <title>Licensing terms for Medusa</title>

    <h1>Medusa is now Free!</h1>
    
    <p>
      Medusa was previously distributed under a 'free for
      non-commercial use' license.  In May of 2000 I changed the
      license to be identical to the standard Python license.  The
      standard Python license has always applied to the core
      components of Medusa, this change just frees up the rest of the
      system, including the http server, ftp server, utilities, etc..
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the folks
      who supported Medusa over the years by purchasing commercial
      licenses.
