  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.1.4
  
    Bugs Fixed
  
      - Generated reports failed in cases where column names contained
	odd characters, as would be the case with::
  
	  select salary*1.2 from payrole
  

  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.1.3
  
    Bugs Fixed
  
      - Changed permission settings to be in line with principia 1.2
  

  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.1.2
  
    Bugs Fixed
  
      - If strings contained backslashes but not backslash-t or
	backslash-n, then the backslashes were getting doubled.
  
  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.1.1
  
    Bugs Fixed
  
      - The SQL string quoting done by the sqlvar and sqltest tags
	failed on non-ANSI-SQL databases like mySQL.  Extra hooks
	were added to allow database adapters to provide custom quoting 
	logic.
  
  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.1.0
  
    Features
  
      - New DTML tags are available in SQLMethods that greatly
	improve the ease, safety, and flexibility of database methods.
  
      - SQL Templates are now rendered in the context of the containing
	folder, rather than the method itself.
  
      - Input arguments are shown in input forms in the order that
	they were defined, rather than in alphabetical order.
  

  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.0.5
  
    Features Fixed
  
      - Database methods are slightly better about binding themselves
	to the correct object when acquired.


  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.0.4
  
    Features Fixed
  
      - RDBMS transaction boundaries now coincide with Principia 
	tranasaction boundaries.  For example, if a Document
	runs 3 database methods and the third method raises an error, 
	then the other methods are aborted.


  Aqueduct SQL Methods 1.0.3
  
    Bugs Fixed
  
      - Add permissions were not editable.
