Z SQL Method - Add: Create new Z SQL Method

Description

    This view allows you to create a new Z SQL Method.

Controls

    'ID' -- Specifies the id of the sql method.

    'Title' -- Specifies the title of the sql method. 

    'Connection id' -- Select list that specifies the database
      connection on which the sql method operates.

      **Note:** If you change the ID of your DB Connection object, all
      the Z SQL Methods using this connection object will *NOT* be
      updated. You have to update all Methods one by one.

    'Arguments' -- Allows you to specify a list of arguments that the sql 
      method takes. The arguments should be separated by spaces or
      a newline in the field. Furthermore, you can specify the 
      type of the argument as well as a default 
      value.

      **Example:** 'title:string="No title!"', where 'title' is the
      attribute, 'string' is the type of the attribute, and '"No
      title!"' is the default value.

    'Query template' -- 

      Text area that specifies the SQL query that will execute when
      this method is called.  The query template can contain DTML
      markup to tailor the SQL statement to the arguments.  There are
      three additional DTML tags called 'SQLVAR', 'SQLTEST', and
      'SQLGROUP'. Please refer to their references get more details on
      how to use them in your SQL statement.

      **Note:** the SQL statement need not be a 'SELECT' query, it may
      be any valid SQL statement including an INSERT or UPDATE.

      **Important:** You can have several SQL statements in one ZSQL
      Method.
