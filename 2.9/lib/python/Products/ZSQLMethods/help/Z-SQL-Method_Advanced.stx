    Description

        Manage the advanced settings such as caching and plugable
        brains of a SQL method.
        
    Controls

        'ID' -- Indicates the id of the sql method.
        
        'Title' -- Allows you to specify the title of the sql method.

        'Connection Hook' -- Specifies the id of a method to be called when the database connection is made. This method will return a string containing the id of the database connection to use. If left blank there is no effect, the connection id specified will be used.

        'Maximum number of rows retrieved' -- Specify an upper limit
        for the number of rows a sql method can retrieve. Setting this
        option correctly (based on your specific environment) can
        increase the execution time of the method.
        
        'Maximum number of results in the cache' -- Set the size of
        the sql method cache.
        
        'Maximum time (seconds) to cache results' -- The time in
        seconds that results are cached.  Setting to zero disables
        caching.
        
	Rows returned from this method can be turned into 'Result
	objects' that are instances of a class you can specify below.
        
        'Class name' -- Allows you to specify the name of the Python class. 
        
        'Class file' -- Allows you to specify the name of the Python
        module that the class is defined in. The class file should
        reside in the Zope 'Extensions' directory.
