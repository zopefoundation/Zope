    Version 1.5.0

      Features Added

        - Error reporting is improved, with line numbers added.

        - In the ZMI, errors are separated from the text and highlighted.

        - A template can be marked explicitly as XML or HTML by giving
        it a boolean 'is_html' property.

        - New icon, provided by Michael R. Bernstein.

      Bugs Fixed

        - The starting properties could be deleted.  This is only
        fixed for new templates.

        - Collector 596 fixed; manage_addPageTemplate can now be
          called with a text argument but no REQUEST.form['file'].
          E.g. when called via ZPublisher.Client.
