<!-- This file can contain any number of examples.

Each one consists of an <example> with a 'name' attribute,
containing exactly one <description>.  The name and description
are displayed in the Examples page.  <description> can have a
'format' attribute set to 'plain' (the default), 'stx' (structured
text), or 'html'.

An <example> can contain <payload> elements.  Each <payload> can
contain any number of <import>, <execute>, and <call> elements.
These are processed in order when an example is selected from the
Examples page.  <import> must have a 'file' attribute that names
a file in the 'examples' directory to be imported.  <execute> must
have a 'file' attribute that names a file to be run with execfile.
<call> must have a 'path' attribute that gives the path to a Zope
object to be called.

An <example> can contain at most one <view> element.  The 'url'
attribute of a <view> is the URL to view after all <payload> elements have
been processed. This URL can be relative to the current folder.
