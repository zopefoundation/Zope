ZClass - Property Sheets: Manage ZClass property sheets.

  Description

    This view allows you to manage a ZClass's property sheets.

    Property sheets provide a way to organize ZClass properties. A property 
    sheet defines default values for ZClass instance attributes and provides 
    an editing method for the attributes.

    The creation and management of property sheets proceeds exactly like 
    the management of a Folder's contents. See "ObjectManager - Contents".
