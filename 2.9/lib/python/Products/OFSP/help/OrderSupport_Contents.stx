ObjectManager with OrderSupport - Contents: Edit contained objects.

  Description

    This view displays the contained objects and allows you to add,
    delete, change and order them.

    Each contained object is displayed on a line and is identified by
    an icon, an id and a title in parenthesis. Additionally, the size
    (if applicable) and the date during which the object was last modified
    are displayed.  You can manage an object by clicking on its identifying
    link.

    Sorting vs. Ordering

      You can sort contained objects by type, name (id), size,
      modification date or by position (fixed order, see below). To do so,
      click on the appropriate column heading. Clicking a second time
      on any column heading (except position) will reverse the sort
      on that field. Sorting takes no actions on the contained
      objects, but will only change the users personal point of view.

      You can order contained objects with the controls on the bottom
      of the page. The order of objects ('sort by position') is stored
      in the database and remains fixed until it is changed by another
      user.

    Versions

      If you are currently working in a version there will be a
      notice at the top of the list of objects indicating this.

      If there is a red diamond following the name of an object this
      indicates that the object has been modified in the version you
      are currently working in. If there is a red diamond with a lock
      after an object, this indicates the the object has been modified
      in another version.

  Controls

    '[Checkbox]' -- Selects the object in order to perform operations
    on it. The operations you can perform are rename, cut, copy,
    delete, and export. Some operations may not be visible if they are
    not allowed.

    'Rename' -- Changes the ids of the selected objects.

    'Cut' -- Cuts selected objects and place them into the
    clipboard. This is similar to cut in most file managers. Cut
    objects can be pasted in a new location. When cut objects are
    pasted into another location the old objects are deleted.

    'Copy' -- Copies selected objects and place them in the
    clipboard. This is similar to copy in most file managers. Copied
    objects can be pasted in a new location.

    'Paste' -- Allows you to paste objects from the clipboard into
    this object. **Note: This option will only appear if objects have
    previously been copied or cut.**

    'Delete' -- Deletes the selected objects. Deleted objects are
    *not* placed in the clipboard.

    'Import/Export' -- Imports or exports a Zope object.

    'Available Objects' -- Selects a type of object to add.

    'Add' -- Adds an object specified in 'Available Objects'.
 
    'Select All (Deselect All)' -- Toggles between selecting and
    deselecting each item currently displayed in the contents view.
    **Note: This control will only appear if your browser is
    javascript-enabled.**

    'Set View as Default' -- Sets current sorted view as default contents view
    for this folder. **Note: This option will only appear if your current
    sorted view is not the default view.**

    (default is 1).
