WebDAV Lock Management - Manage Locks

 Description

  This view allows you to manage WebDAV WriteLocks.  WebDAV, as an
  extension to the HTTP Protocol, allows the users to create *Write
  Locks* as a way of trying to avoid the "lost updates problem".
  However, sometimes WriteLocks may become abandoned.  This may be due 
  to users forgetting to unlock their resources, software failures
  such as crashes, etc.  In many cases, locks might just time out
  before this becomes a problem.  In cases where it's not, this
  control panel object may be used to locate locked resources inside
  of Zope and clear *ALL* of their WebDAV writelocks.  **This does not 
  clear locks caused by use of Versions**.

 Controls

  'Path' -- This lets you enter a path (based off the root of the Zope 
  site) to filter down the list of locked objects.  Clicking 'Go'
  executes the filter.

  When locked objects are found, they are listed one per line with a
  checkbox that can be used to select the item.  Also listed in each
  line is information about the lock(s) on the object - the user who
  created the lock (identified by the path to the user folder the user 
  is defined in), and the locktoken that identifies the lock.  In the
  majority of cases, there should only be one lock per object.

  '[Checkbox]' -- Selects locked items.

  'Select All' -- This button marks all items displayed as selected.

  'Deselect All' -- After 'Select All' has been clicked, it changes to 
  say 'Deselect All'.  Clicking this deselects all displayed items.

  'Unlock objects' -- Unlocks the selected items.
