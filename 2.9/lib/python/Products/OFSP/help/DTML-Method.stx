DTML Method: Template object.
  
  Description
    
    DTML Methods provide general templating and scripting facilities.

    DTML Documents can contain scripting commands in Document
    Template Markup Language (DTML), which allows for dynamic
    behavior.

    Unlike DTML Documents, DTML Methods have no properties, and lookup
    variables in the namespace of the object they are bound to.
