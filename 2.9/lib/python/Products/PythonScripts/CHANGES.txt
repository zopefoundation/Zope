        * Version 2.0.0
        * Totally replaced zbytecodhacks engine with Zope's new
        RestrictedPython package, which it shares with DTML.

1999-12-13  Evan Simpson <evan@4-am.com>

	* Version 0.1.7
	* Nested functions and lambdas are now supported, with full safety.
	* You can access all of the dtml-var format functions through a builtin
	dictionary called special_formats (eg: special_formats['html-quote']).
	* Handing off to Digital Creations for inclusion in CVS.
	* Packaged with packProduct script, which excludes parent directories
	and .pyc files.  Makes for a smaller package, and doesn't step on
	ownership/permissions of lib/python/Products path elements.

	* Added COPYRIGHT.txt, making Wide Open Source licence (BSD-style)
	explicit. (Mike Goldman provided the text, I provided the silly name).
	* Jeff Rush donated a PrincipiaSearchSource method, so that 
	PythonMethod objects can be zcataloged to the same degree
	as DTML Methods.
	* Also from Jeff Rush, a document_src method, so that the source of
	PythonMethods can be viewed via a "View Source" link if desired.
	* If a PM has a 'traverse_subpath' parameter, you can now directly
	traverse it.  The elements of the subpath will then be put into a list
	in 'traverse_subpath'. (thanks to Anthony Baxter)

	* Version 0.1.6
	* Fix to builtins messed up DTML Methods, so I re-fixed it.

1999-11-05  Evan Simpson <evan@4-am.com>

	* Version 0.1.5
	* Killed *%#&$@ weird bug in which having 'add' documents in 'www'
	subdirectory prevented rename, paste, or import of existing
	PythonMethods! See use of '_www'.
	* Range, test, and several other Zope 'builtins' had an unbound 'self'
	argument unless called on _, but that's fixed.
	* Safe multiplication was utterly broken (thanks to the guard); now
	it works.  Is anyone using the safe version??

	* Eliminated bug which delayed stringification of printed values.

1999-10-08  Evan Simpson <evan@4-am.com>

	* Version 0.1.4
	* Fixed mis-design noticed by Michel Pelletier, and refactored
	MakeFunction.  Now both kinds of Python Method have the bugfix
	from 0.1.3, and shouldn't provoke a transaction when called.

1999-10-07  Evan Simpson <evan@4-am.com>

	* Version 0.1.3
	* Fixed parameter bug with 'self' and no defaults

1999-09-24  Evan Simpson <evan@4-am.com>

        * Version 0.1.2
        * Added WebDAV/FTP access code donated by Michel Pelletier
        * Made parameters part of WebDAV/FTP text
        * Eliminated initialization of globals to None
        * Added 'global_exists' global function instead
        * Killed bug with unused parameters
        * Put switch in Guarded.py to allow both regular and
        dangerous (XXX) PythonMethods to live side-by-side.
        This means that people who patched version 0.1.1
        will have to re-create any unsafe PMs they use (Sorry).

1999-09-10  Evan Simpson <evan@4-am.com>

        * Version 0.1.1
	* Incorporated DT_Util builtins and guards
	* Fixed direct access via URL
	* Fixed methodAdd.dtml
	* rstrip function body
	* Major changes to zbytecodehacks
