Test View: Test a Script (Python)
  
    Description

        This view allows you to test a Script (Python) instance.
        
    Controls

        If a Script has no parameters, when the "Test" tab is
        visited the return value of the script will be presented in
        the manage_main frame.

        However, if a Script instance has parameters, a form
        will be presented with fields for "Parameter" and "Value",
        changeable on a per-parameter basis.  These accept string
        values.  The 'Run Script' button runs the script after the
        'Parameter' and 'Value' fields have been filled in, and
        returns the results in the manage_main frame.
