ZCatalog - Indexes: Manage Catalog Indexes
  
    Description

        This view allows you to manage the catalog indexes.
        
        The catalog provides searching by indexing information about
        cataloged objects. Indexes record information about object
        attributes.
        
    Controls

        '[List of Indexes]' -- Each line contains one Index entry. The
        checkbox in the front allows you to mark an index for
        deletion. Next the Index name is listed which corresponds to
        attribute names of various objects.
        
        'Delete' -- The checkmarked Index(es) will be deleted.
        
        'Add Index' - Name -- Allows you to enter the name of a new
        index.
        
        '[Type of Index]' -- You have the choice between four types of
        Indexes, called 'TextIndex', 'FieldIndex', 'KeywordIndex' and
        'PathIndex'.  Please refer to the table below to see a
        description of each Index.
        
        'Add' -- The new Index will be added to this catalog.
      
        This table lists the different Index types and describes their
        purpose.
        
        'TextIndex' -- TextIndexes break content up into individual
        words. These indexes are often refered to as *full-text
        indexes*. Text indexes sort results by score, meaning they
        return 'hits' in order from the most relevant to the lest
        relevant.
        
        'FieldIndex' -- FieldIndexes treat the value of an objects
        attribute atomically, and can be used, for example, to track
        only a certain subset of object values, such as 'meta_type'.
        
        'KeywordIndex' -- KeywordIndexes index a sequence of objects
        that act as 'keywords' for an object. A Keyword Index will
        return any objects that have one or more keywords specified in
        a search query.

        'PathIndex' -- Index the physical path of a sequence of
        objects. A Path Index will return all objects that match a
        partitial path specified in a search query.

        'TopicIndex' -- A TopicIndex is a container for so-called
        FilteredSet.  A FilteredSet consists of an expression and a set
        of internal ZCatalog document identifiers that represent a
        pre-calculated result list for performance reasons. Instead of
        executing the same query on a ZCatalog multiple times it is much
        faster to use a TopicIndex instead.
