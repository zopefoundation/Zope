ZCatalog - Find Items to ZCatalog: Add records to the Catalog
  
    Description

        This view allows you to add records to the catalog.
        
        This view operates like a normal find view (see "Folder - Find") 
        to locate objects for cataloging. Objects which match the find criteria 
        will be added to the catalog.
