            messageText -- The mail message. It can either be a rfc822
            formed text with header fields, or just a body without any
            header fields. The other arguments given will override the
            header fields in the message, if they exist.

            mto -- A commaseparated string or list of recipient(s) of the message.

            mfrom -- The address of the message sender.

            subject -- The subject of the message.

            encode -- The rfc822 defined encoding of the message.  The
            default of 'None' means no encoding is done.  Valid values
