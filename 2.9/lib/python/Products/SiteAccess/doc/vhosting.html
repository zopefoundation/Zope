<h4>Getting Started</h4>
Before you can set up virtual hosting in Zope, you need to answer two questions:
<ul>
<li>What is the URI of each site's logical root?</li>
<li>What is the corresponding path to the physical root?</li>
</ul>
Suppose, for example, that you want to use Zope to host the domain www.hotsite.com,
and you want 'http://www.hotsite.com' to publish the Zope object '/hotsite/index_html'.
Then 'http://www.hotsite.com' is the URI of your logical root, and '/hotsite' is the
path to your physical root.
<h4>Example 1: One Site</h4>
Put a SiteRoot in '/hotsite', your site's physical root, and accept the
 default Path.  Create a DTML Method in the Zope root folder containing
<pre>
Is the first-level domain 'hotsite.com'? Ignore sub-domains and port number.
&lt;dtml-if &quot;_.string.split(_.string.split(HTTP_HOST, ':')[0], '.')[-2:]==['hotsite', 'com']&quot;&gt;
  Add physical root: 
  &lt;dtml-call &quot;REQUEST['TraversalRequestNameStack'].append('hotsite')&quot;&gt;
&lt;/dtml-if &gt;
</pre>
Use "Set Access Rule" with the DTML Method's Id.  Want to understand this? Read on.
<h4>Getting Physical</h4>
The first half of virtual hosting is rewriting incoming URIs into physical
 paths.  Many people run ZServer behind Apache, or another HTTP server with
 rewriting capabilities, or a proxy.  In these cases, you can tell the
 front-end HTTP server to rewrite 'http://www.hotsite.com/(.*)' to
 '/blah/cgi/Zope.cgi/hotsite/$1', for example.
<br><br>
This works perfectly well, but if your clients are connecting directly to
 ZServer, or if you would like to keep all of the virtual hosting logic
 in Zope, you will need to do your rewriting in an Access Rule.
<br><br>
An Access Rule is just a regular method (DTML Method or Document, External
 Method, Python Method, etc.) on which you have used SiteAccess' 
"Set Access Rule" method.  In this case, the method lives in the root, so it
 will examine every incoming request and decide how to deal with it.
<br><br>
The example DTML Method above is the simplest kind of rewrite rule, forcing
all requests to traverse the 'hotsite' object before any others in the URI.
<h4>Getting Logical</h4>
The second, and more difficult, half of virtual hosting is getting your Zope
 objects to generate correct logical URIs for links and images.  For example,
 if you are rewriting hotsite as described above, then a standard DTML snippet
 such as
<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;dtml-URL;/hottopics&quot;&gt;
</pre>
in object '/hotsite/forum' will generate
<pre>
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotsite.com/hotsite/forum/hottopics&quot;&gt;
rather than
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotsite.com/forum/hottopics&quot;&gt;
</pre>
To prevent this, all of the URLn and BASEn request variables and the
 absolute_url() method need to be told to strip off '/hotsite'.  That's what
 SiteRoot objects do.
<br><br>
A SiteRoot object should be placed in the physical root folder ('/hotsite', in
 this case) and told the logical URL at which to base all requests passing
 through this folder.  You tell it by setting its Path property, which in this
 case should have the value '/'. 
<br><br>
For flexibility's sake, Path can also be set
 as a property 'SiteRootPATH' of the '/hotsite' folder or of the root folder,
 or it can be set in the rewriting Access Rule with a call to 
 "REQUEST.set('SiteRootPATH', '/')", or it can be passed in from the
 mediating web server as an environment variable.  You can also provide
 a Base ('SiteRootBASE') value, which will then replace the host:port/script
 portion of URIs.
<h4>Example 2: Multiple Sites</h4>
Suppose we are hosting 'hotsite.net', 'fooflowers.com', and 'openmouths.org'
 from '/hotsite', '/foof', and '/openm' respectively.  We are distinguishing
 requests via HTTP_HOST, and we don't care what subdomain or port was specified.
<br><br>
Put a SiteRoot in each of '/hotsite', '/foof', and '/openm'.
In each one, <b>erase</b> the default Path and leave Base blank.
Make a DTML Method in the root folder containing
<pre>
Extract the part of HTTP_HOST we care about, and declare our rewrite dictionary.
&lt;dtml-let hostname=&quot;_.string.join(_.string.split(_.string.split(HTTP_HOST, ':')[0], '.')[-2:], '.')&quot;
          sitemap=&quot;{'hotsite.net': 'hotsite',
                    'fooflowers.com': 'foof',
                    'openmouths.org': 'openm'}&quot;&gt;
    Do we have a match?
    &lt;dtml-if expr=&quot;sitemap.has_key(hostname)&quot;&gt;
Set the logical root: &lt;dtml-call &quot;REQUEST.set('SiteRootPATH', '/')&quot;&gt;
Add physical root: &lt;dtml-call &quot;REQUEST['TraversalRequestNameStack'].append(sitemap[hostname])&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/dtml-if&gt;
&lt;/dtml-let&gt;
</pre>
Use "Set Access Rule" with the DTML Method's Id.  An almost identical method
 can be used to distinguish sites by SERVER_ADDRESS and SERVER_PORT instead
 of HTTP_HOST.  In that case, though, you would probably add a line to set the
 appropriate SiteRootBASE.
<br><br>
If you wanted all of these virtual hosts' root folders to live in the folder
 'vhosts', you could add the line:
<pre>
Add vhost root: &lt;dtml-call &quot;REQUEST['TraversalRequestNameStack'].append('vhosts')&quot;&gt; 
</pre>
<b>after</b> the 'Add physical root' line.  If you wanted to add multiple path
 elements for each site, you could use path.extend instead of path.append and
 map 'fooflowers.org', for example, to ['foof', 'f', 'comsites'].  This would
 place the root of fooflowers in folder '/comsites/f/foof/'.
<h4>Minor Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The return value of an Access Rule is ignored and discarded.  This allows
 embedded string comments such as in the examples above, and the use of
 &lt;dtml-return &quot; 'ignored' &quot;&gt; to exit the Rule.
It also means that if you want to redirect within an Access Rule, you must use
&lt;dtml-raise type=&quot;Redirect&quot;&gt; instead of
 &quot;RESPONSE.redirect()&quot;</li>
<li>A SiteRoot object is essentially an Access Rule which calls<br>
REQUEST.setServerURL(SiteRootBASE) and REQUEST.setVirtualRoot(SiteRootPATH).
<li>You might want to exempt management access from being affected by the
 virtual hosting.  One way to do this is to have a 'magic folder' start all
 management interactions.  I use 'Z', and wrap the rest of the Access Rule
 code in something like:
<pre>
Is there a path, and does it start with 'Z'?
&lt;dtml-let stack=&quot;REQUEST['TraversalRequestNameStack']&quot;&gt;
&lt;dtml-if &quot;stack and stack[-1]=='Z'&quot;&gt;
Get rid of 'Z':     &lt;dtml-call &quot;stack.pop()&quot;&gt;
Put it back logically: &lt;dtml-call &quot;REQUEST.setVirtualRoot('Z')&quot;&gt;
&lt;dtml-else&gt;
...
&lt;/dtml-if&gt;
&lt;/dtml-let&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>If a SiteRooted folder is <strong>ever</strong> accessed through URLs with
a base or path that does not get rewritten to match the Base and Path of the SiteRoot,
you should make the SiteRoot's Base and Path blank and dynamically create SiteRootPATH/SiteRootBASE
variables.  For example, if you made a 'Zope' global-access prefix as described
above, then the 'else' part should contain something like
&lt;dtml-call &quot;REQUEST.set('SiteRootPATH', '/')&quot;&gt;.
</li>
