      This is why we have to duplicate this template: we want to look
      up the @@form_macros browser page from something that's
      definitely five:traversable (it doesn't really matter where we
      look it up, just *that* we look it up); we know the object we're
      editing is five:traversable, so we just use that.  Yes, three
      times context.  Weird, eh?
