  Extension Class Definitions

  Implementing base extension classes
  
    A base extension class is implemented in much the same way that an
    extension type is implemented, except:
  
    - The include file, 'ExtensionClass.h', must be included.
 
    - The type structure is declared to be of type
	  'PyExtensionClass', rather than of type 'PyTypeObject'.
 
    - The type structure has an additional member that must be defined
	  after the documentation string.  This extra member is a method chain
	  ('PyMethodChain') containing a linked list of method definition
	  ('PyMethodDef') lists.  Method chains can be used to implement
	  method inheritance in C.  Most extensions don't use method chains,
	  but simply define method lists, which are null-terminated arrays
	  of method definitions.  A macro, 'METHOD_CHAIN' is defined in
	  'ExtensionClass.h' that converts a method list to a method chain.
	  (See the example below.)
  
    - Module functions that create new instances must be replaced by an
	  '__init__' method that initializes, but does not create storage for 
	  instances.
  
    - The extension class must be initialized and exported to the module
	  with::
  
	      PyExtensionClass_Export(d,"name",type);
  
	  where 'name' is the module name and 'type' is the extension class
	  type object.
  
    Attribute lookup
  
	  Attribute lookup is performed by calling the base extension class
	  'getattr' operation for the base extension class that includes C
	  data, or for the first base extension class, if none of the base
	  extension classes include C data.  'ExtensionClass.h' defines a
	  macro 'Py_FindAttrString' that can be used to find an object's
	  attributes that are stored in the object's instance dictionary or
	  in the object's class or base classes::
  
	     v = Py_FindAttrString(self,name);
  
	  In addition, a macro is provided that replaces 'Py_FindMethod'
	  calls with logic to perform the same sort of lookup that is
	  provided by 'Py_FindAttrString'.
  
    Linking
  
	  The extension class mechanism was designed to be useful with
	  dynamically linked extension modules.  Modules that implement
	  extension classes do not have to be linked against an extension
	  class library.  The macro 'PyExtensionClass_Export' imports the
	  'ExtensionClass' module and uses objects imported from this module
	  to initialize an extension class with necessary behavior.
