Unreleased
- transaction.commit(1) is deprecated in favor of transaction.savepoint().
- Don't break if Python distros ship without profile support (Debian, Ubuntu).
- Functional.publish() would hang if it got a request_method argument other
  than GET or HEAD while omitting the stdin argument.
- installProduct() now becomes a noop if ZopeTestCase did not apply its
  patches.
- Made the functional doc tests set the cookie related headers.

0.9.8 (Zope 2.8 edition)
- Renamed 'doctest' package to 'zopedoctest' because of name-shadowing
  issues discovered during integration into Zope 2.8. Tests may still use
  'from Testing.ZopeTestCase import doctest' as the name is aliased there.
- Greatly improved the doctest story. ZopeTestCase now implements four test
  suite factories: ZopeDocTestSuite, ZopeDocFileSuite, FunctionalDocTestSuite,
  and FunctionalDocFileSuite.
- Removed warnhook.py, we now use the one from ZODB.tests.
- Removed doctest.py, we now use the one from zope.testing.
- Removed dochttp.py + test, we now use the one from zope.app.tests.
- ZopeLite now takes care not to monkey patch an already started Zope.
- PortalTestCase.setUp() no longer calls _refreshSkinData() as CMF is smart
  enough now.
- Fixed PortalTestCase._refreshSkinData() helper to work with CMF >= 1.5.
- Made PortalTestCase.createMemberarea() work better with CMF >= 1.5.
- Fixed a bug where using sessions in sandboxed (functional) tests would cause
  connection pool depletion and subsequent hangs. Thanks to Balazs Ree.
- Encapsulated the ConnectionRegistry in its own module, connections.py.
  Reusing the registry from other modules becomes a lot cleaner as a result.
- Made sure to close the REQUEST so as not to leak REQUEST._held. Thanks
  to Sidnei da Silva.
- Modified runalltests.py so it imports modules more like test.py, i.e.
  without touching sys.path and without the help of imp.
- The standalone version of ZopeTestCase gained a Zope 2.8-style transaction
  module. Tests may now use 'from Testing.ZopeTestCase import transaction'
  which is guaranteed to work across Zope versions.
- The REQUEST now contains the ACTUAL_URL variable introduced in Zope 2.7.4.

0.9.6
- Dropped support for Zope 2.5 as it lacks the setSecurityManager() API.
- Moved interfaces from doc section to interfaces.py module.
- Test classes now assert their interfaces.
- Refactored security interfaces to IZopeSecurity and IPortalSecurity.
- Added a class diagram to the doc section.
- setRoles() and setPermissions() no longer insist on ListType arguments
  but now accept lists, tuples, and strings.
- getRoles() and getPermissions() are no longer part of the security API
  because of YAGNI.
- Added getHeader() and getCookie() accessors to the response wrapper
  used in functional tests.
- publish() now accepts an optional 'stdin' argument, allowing to pass
  the input stream for POST and PUT requests.
- runalltests.py now supports a '-R' (recursive) command line option.

0.9.4 (not released)
- Backported functional doc tests from Zope 3.
- Included a copy of doctest.py from Zope 3 (which is copied from
  Python2.4 CVS). It will be removed when we start requiring Python2.4.
- Added dochttp.py script from Zope 3, which is used to convert
  tcpwatch.py output to functional doc tests.
- Added warnhook.py from ZODB. It is used to capture the output of
  warnings.warn() calls.
- Added missing 'user_password' constant.
- Many thanks to Sidnei da Silva!

0.9.2
- Introduced new base.TestCase class which contains the bare-
  bones framework code and serves as baseclass for ZTC and PTC.
- ZopeLite now configures the logging module in Zope >= 2.7.
- Teardown sequence is now compatible with Zope trunk (again).
- Added getRoles() and getPermissions() methods to security API.
- setRoles() now asserts 'roles' argument is ListType.
- setPermissions() now asserts 'permissions' argument is ListType.

0.9.0
- No longer support Zope 2.4 as its DemoStorage is broken.
- Made PortalTestCase derive from ZopeTestCase (again).
- Made all xTestCases profiler aware by default.
- Renamed the Profiler module to profiler.py (lowercase).
- Added support for ZODB sandboxes, sandbox.py.
- Added support for functional unit testing, functional.py.
- The profiler module now provides a dump_stats() method to write
  profiler statistics to a file for manual inspection.
- The REQUEST now fakes a published object to make the URL1
  request variable available to tests. Thanks to Alan Runyan.
- startZServer() now accepts a log argument, allowing to pass
  a stream which the ZServer access log (Z2.log) will be written to.
- The 'app' argument of utility functions is now optional.
- Fixed custom_zodb.py support for Zope 2.7.
- Most mercilessly refactored ztc_common.py.
- ZopeLite now loads silently if it does not control the import process.

0.8.6
- Revised and amended much of the existing documentation.
- Added an API reference (skeleton), API.stx.
- Documented what's going on when tests are run in TIMELINES.txt.
- Fixed issues with testZODBCompat.py and Zope < 2.6.
- setupZGlobals() now uses a new-style BTrees.OOBTree.
- Profiling can now be activated from the command line.

0.8.4
- framework.py now flushes stdout to not mess up the output in batch mode.
- framework.py no longer adds os.pardir to the sys.path. Thanks to
  Yoshinori Okuji.
- Made sure user objects are not inadvertently wrapped twice by login().
- Made sure "renegade" transactions are aborted if something goes wrong
  during the setup phase.
- initialize_cache() is no longer called for Zope 2.7.

0.8.2
- Removed the leading underscores from all constant names. They proved
  non-private in "real life" anyway. The old names are still available
  for backward compatibility, but are deprecated.
- Removed NO_PRODUCT_LOAD for reasons of obscureness and YAGNI.
- Added a test for ZODB behavior in ZTC, testZODBCompat.py.

0.8.0
- Added a PortalTestCase base class to aid testing of CMF-style portals.
- Added simple profiling support using the Python profile library.
- Got rid of the ill-conceived FX interface (don't even ask).
- ZopeLite now supports Zope 2.7.

0.7.2 (not released)
- ZopeLite gained a do-nothing startup() method for API compliance.
- The ZopeTestCase module now has a main() method like unittest has.
- Made sure the test user's 'roles' attribute is a list because CMF
  role-mapping assumes it can append to it. :-/

0.7.0
- Fixed a bug that caused setRoles() to only work with the
  default user folder. Refactored the fixture code in the process.
- Reworked the connection registry and wrote tests for it.
- Made afterClear() largely redundant because it turned out to be just that.
- Added close() method to be able to close ZODB connections individually.
- Added ISimpleSecurity and IExtensibleSecurity interfaces.

0.6.4
- installProduct() now immediately fails if a product throws an
  exception during installation. Thanks to Tom Jenkins.
- The REQUEST no longer contains the entire shell environment.
- Moved all documentation files to the 'doc' subdirectory.
- Added IZopeTestCase and IZopeTestCaseFX interfaces.

0.6.2
- The effects of setting INSTANCE_HOME have been changed to something
  less surprising. Please see ENVIRONMENT.txt for details.

  support.

  after too many errors.
- All tests are now transactional by default.
- Added beforeSetUp() and beforeClose() hooks to the ZopeTestCase class.

  cache. Repair Zope 2.4 Testing package issue in the process.
- Provide NO_PRODUCT_LOAD environment variable for completeness.
- Added hasProduct() method to allow testing for product availability.
- Added new utility method setupZGlobals().
- Added a skeleton test suite, testSkeleton.py.

- Added CHANGES, INSTALL, and VERSION documents.

0.5.0
