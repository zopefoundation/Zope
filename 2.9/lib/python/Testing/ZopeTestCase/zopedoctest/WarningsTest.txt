Dummy Test
==========

This dummy test is used to verify that passing in a ``test_class``
that doesn't subclass ``ZopeTestCase.Functional`` still works but
issues a warning.

  >>> from Testing import ZopeTestCase as zopetest
  >>> hook = zopetest.WarningsHook()
  >>> hook.install()
  >>> suite = zopetest.FunctionalDocFileSuite('WarningsTest.txt',
  ...                                         package=zopetest.zopedoctest,
  ...                                         test_class=zopetest.ZopeTestCase)

  >>> len(hook.warnings)
  1

  >>> message, category, filename, lineno = hook.warnings[0]
  >>> message
  "The test_class you are using doesn't subclass from ZopeTestCase.Functional. Please fix that."
  >>> category.__name__
  'UserWarning'

We have to uninstall the hook so that other warnings don't get lost.

  >>> hook.uninstall()
