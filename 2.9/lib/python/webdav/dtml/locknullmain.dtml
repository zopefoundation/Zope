<p>This item is <span style="color: red">locked by WebDAV</span> as a
  <strong>Lock-Null Resource</strong>.  A lock-null resource is
  created when a resource is locked before it is fully created,
  basically reserving its name.  When the owner of this resource
  issues a command to either fill it with content, or turn it into a
  collection (folder), that object will replace this one.</p>
