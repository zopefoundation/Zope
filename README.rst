affected by `an important security issue

The fixed version 2.1.1 is not compatible with Python 3.6. We strongly
advise you to either upgrade your Zope installation to at least Python 3.7,
or `switch to a different WSGI server
<https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operation.html#recommended-wsgi-servers>`_.
