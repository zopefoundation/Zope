5.0 (2020-10-08)
----------------

Backwards incompatible changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Drop support for Python 3.5 as it will run out of support soon.
  (`#841 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/841>`_)


Features
++++++++

- HTTP header encoding support
  (`#905 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/905>`_)

- Add support for Python 3.9.

- New interface ``Products.PageTemplates.interfaces.IZopeAwareEngine``.
  It can be used as the "provides" of an adapter registration
  to adapt a non ``Zope`` tales engine to an engine to be used
  by ``Zope`` page templates
  (`#864 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/864>`_).
  Currently, the adaptation is used only when the
  template is rendered with ``chameleon``;
  with ``zope.pagetemplate``, the engine is used
  as is - this may change in the future.

- Allow (some) builtins as first element of a (TALES) path expression:
  in an untrusted context, the builtins from
  ``AccessControl.safe_builtins`` are allowed;
  in a trusted context, all Python builtins are allowed in addition
  (and take precedence)
  (`zope.tales#23 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.tales/issues/23>`_).

- Support the ``attrs`` predefined template variable again (as
  far as ``chameleon`` allows it)
  (`#860 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/860>`_).

- Use ``Chameleon`` (>= 3.7.2) configuration to get better
  information for errors detected during template execution
  (`#837 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/837>`_).

Fixes
+++++

- Provide a more senseful ``OFS.SimpleItem.Item_w__name__.id``
  to avoid bugs by use of deprecated direct ``id`` access
  (as e.g. (`#903 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/903>`_).

- Update to ``zope.interface > 5.1.0`` to fix a memory leak.

- Fix export of files with non-latin-1 compatible names
  (`#890 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/890>`_)

- Avoid unsolicited translations
  (`#876 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/876>`_)

- Make "chameleon-zope context wrapping" more faithful.
  (`#873 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/873/files>`_)

- Let "unicode conflict resolution" work for all templates (not just
  ``ZopePageTemplate``).
  (`#872 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/872/files>`_)

- Make "Unicode Conflict Resolution" available for templates
  rendered with ``chameleon``
  (`Products.CMFPlone#3145
  <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3145>`_).

- Improve documentation of ``CONTEXTS`` in the "Zope Book".

- Decrease cookie size for copy/paste clipboard cookie
  (`#854 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/854>`_)

- Fix ``default`` keyword handling in page templates
  (`#846 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/846>`_)

- Fix parsing of package version and show correct major version in the ZMI

- Improve solidity of the ``debugError`` method.
  (`#829 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/829>`_)

- Fix that ``ZTUtils.LazyFilter`` could not be imported inside a restricted
  Python script.
  (`#901 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/901>`_)

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- Add ``pyupgrade`` via ``pre-commit``
  (`#859 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/859>`_)

- Add ``tal:switch`` test


5.0a2 (2020-04-24)
------------------

Bug fixes
+++++++++

- Pin ``AccessControl`` 4.2 for the `Manage WebDAV Locks` permission

- Fix ``HEAD`` requests on registered views
  (`#816 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/816>`_)

- Improve ``chameleon`` --> ``zope.tales`` context wrapper
  (support for template variable injection)
  (`#812 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/812>`_).

- Require ``zope.tales>=5.0.2``

- Fix issue 717 by fully honoring the engine returned by
  ``PageTemplate.pt_getEngine``
  (`#717 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/717>`_).
  The engine also decides about the use of ``zope.tales``
  (engine is an instance of ``zope.pagetemplate.engine.ZopeBaseEngine``)
  or ``chameleon.tales`` (otherwise) TALES expressions.

- Fixed encoding issue of `displayname` WebDAV property
  (`#797 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/797>`_)

- Fixed fallback implementation of ``manage_DAVget``
  (`#799 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/799>`_)

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- Update to newest versions of dependencies.

  (`#692 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/692>`_)

  Many tests in ``Products.PageTemplates`` used the old Zope page template
