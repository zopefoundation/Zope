5.0a2 (unreleased)
------------------

(These are the changes since Zope 4.3 Besides the backwards incompatible
changes all changes have been merged back to Zope 4.x.)

Backwards incompatible changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- None, yet.

New features
++++++++++++

- Add preliminary support for Python 3.9: the latest pre-release is tested.

Bug fixes
+++++++++

- Improve ``chameleon`` --> ``zope.tales`` context wrapper
  (support for template variable injection)
  (`#812 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/812>`_).

- Require ``zope.tales>=5.0.2``

  ``PageTemplate.pt_getEngine``
  (`#717 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/717>`_).

  (engine is an instance of ``zope.pagetemplate.engine.ZopeBaseEngine``)
  or ``chameleon.tales`` (otherwise) TALES expressions.
