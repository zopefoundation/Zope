4.8.10 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Tighten down the ZMI frame source logic to only allow site-local sources.
  Problem reported by Miguel Segovia Gil.


4.8.9 (2023-09-05)
------------------

- Update ``RestrictedPython`` to version 5.4 to fix a potential a security
  issue. (CVE-2023-41039)

------------------

- Sanitize tainting fixing
  `#1095 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1095>`_

- Restore filename on code objects of objects returned from
  ``App.Extensions.getObject()``. This got lost in 4.0a6.


4.8.7 (2023-01-10)
------------------

- Only set response header Content-Type as text/html on exception views when
  the response has content.
  (`#1089 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1089>`_)

- Update dependencies to the latest releases for each supported Python version.


4.8.6 (2022-12-19)
------------------

- Explicitly serve ``App.Dialogs.MessageDialog`` and exception views as HTML
  due to the changed default content type from `#1075
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1075>`_.


4.8.5 (2022-12-17)
------------------

- Fix some broken ZMI pages due to the changed default content type
  from PR https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1075

- Update dependencies to the latest releases for each supported Python version.


4.8.4 (2022-12-16)
------------------

- Set the published default ``Content-Type`` header to ``text/plain``
  if none has been set explicitly to prevent a cross-site scripting attack.
  Also remove the old behavior of constructing an HTML page for published
  methods returning a two-item tuple.

- Update dependencies to the latest releases for each supported Python version.

- Make ``Products.PageTemplates`` compatible with Chameleon 3.10.


4.8.3 (2022-10-31)
------------------

- Update dependencies to the latest releases for each supported Python version.

- Fix cookie path parameter handling:
  If the cookie path value contains ``%`` it is assumed to be
  fully quoted and used as is;
  if it contains only characters allowed (unquoted)
  in an URL path (with the exception of ``;``),
  it is used as is; otherwise, it is quoted using Python's
  ``urllib.parse.quote``
  (`#1052 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1052>`_).

- Change functional testing utilities to support percent encoded and unicode
  paths (`#1058 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1058>`_).

- Add more notices to the documentation urging users to migrate to Zope 5.

- Quote all components of a redirect URL (not only the path component)
  (`#1027 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1027>`_)

- Drop the convenience script generation from the buildout configuration
  in order to get rid of a lot of dependency version pins.
  These were only needed for maintainers who can install them manually.
  (`#1019 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1019>`_)

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.

- Strip leading ``.`` in cookie domain names.
  (`#1041 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1041>`_)


4.8.1 (2022-04-05)
------------------

- The pip requirements files ``requirements-full.txt`` and ``constraints.txt``
  are now maintained manually.

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.

- Update ``waitress`` to version 2.1.1 to mitigate a vulnerability in that
  package. As ``waitress`` no longer supports Python versions less than
  3.7 it is not advised to run Zope 4 on Python 2.7, 3.5 or 3.6 any longer,
  even though they are still supported by Zope 4 itself.

- To run ``bin/buildout`` inside the Zope project now ``zc.buildout >= 2.13.7``
  or ``zc.buildout >= 3.0.0b1`` is required.


4.8 (2022-03-10)
----------------

- Improve source documentation for methods ``_read_data`` and
  ``get_content_type`` of ``OFS.Image.File`` and
  fix its ``PUT``
  (`#1015 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1015>`_).

- Enhance cookie support. For details, see
  `#1010 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1010>`_

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.


4.7 (2022-01-09)
----------------

- Audit and fix all hyperlinks in code and documentation

  - Change zope.org references to zope.dev due to ongoing domain ownership
    issues. zope.dev is owned by the Plone Foundation and thus safe from
    interference. XML/ZCML namespace URLs remain unchanged.
  - Remove all links that are completely dead, such as the old zope.org
    Collectors issue trackers.
  - Update all other miscellaneous links to make them work again or remove if
    the information is gone.

- Improve type guessing for the default WebDAV PUT factory
  (`#997 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/997>`_)

- Enable WebDAV PUT factories to change a newly created object's ID
  (`#997 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/997>`_)

- Fix potential race condition in ``App.version_txt.getZopeVersion``
  (`#999 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/999>`_)

- Reinstate simple sessioning with ``Products.TemporaryFolder``
  because the underlying issues with ``tempstorage`` have been fixed.
  (`#985 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/985>`_)

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.


4.6.3 (2021-07-31)
------------------

- Updated/fixed the poll application tutorial in the Zope Developers Guide
  (`#958 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/958>`_)

- Depend on ``zope.datetime`` for the functions ``iso8601_date``,
  ``rfc850_date``, and ``rfc1123_date`` which used to be in ``App.Common``
  keeping backwards-compatibility imports in place.

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.


4.5.5 (2021-03-02)
------------------

- Enforce Zope permissions during recursive XML-RPC data dumps
  (`#954 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/954>`_)

Fixes
+++++

- Convert ``bytes`` (Python 3) and ``unicode`` (Python 2) values for
  HTTP response headers into native strings using the HTTP/1.1
  stipulated ``ISO-8859-1`` encoding. This makes ``waitress`` happy
  which insists on native strings for those values.
  (Fix for `#905 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/905>`_)


4.5.2 (2020-11-12)
------------------

Backward incompatible changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Exclude characters special for ``chameleon``'s interpolation syntax
  (i.e. ``${}``) from use in TALES path expressions to reduce the failure risk
  for the ``chameleon`` interpolation heuristics
  (`#925 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/925>`_)

Fixes
+++++

- Fix ``length`` for page template repeat variables
  (`#913 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/913>`_)

  (`#901 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/901>`_)


4.5.1 (2020-08-13)
------------------

- Avoid unsolicited translations
  (`#876 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/876>`_)

- Make "chameleon-zope context wrapping" more faithful.
  (`#873 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/873/files>`_)

- Let "unicode conflict resolution" work for all templates (not just
  ``ZopePageTemplate``).
  (`#872 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/872/files>`_)

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.


4.5 (2020-07-09)
----------------

- Make "Unicode Conflict Resolution" available for templates
  rendered with ``chameleon``
  (`Products.CMFPlone#3145
  <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3145>`_).

- New interface ``Products.PageTemplates.interfaces.IZopeAwareEngine``.
  It can be used as the "provides" of an adapter registration
  to adapt a non ``Zope`` tales engine to an engine to be used
  by ``Zope`` page templates
  (`#864 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/864>`_).
  Currently, the adaptation is used only when the
  template is rendered with ``chameleon``;
  with ``zope.pagetemplate``, the engine is used
  as is - this may change in the future.

- Allow (some) builtins as first element of a (TALES) path expression:
  in an untrusted context, the builtins from
  ``AccessControl.safe_builtins`` are allowed;
  in a trusted context, all Python builtins are allowed in addition
  (and take precedence)
  (`zope.tales#23 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.tales/issues/23>`_).

- Add ``tal:switch`` test

- Support the ``attrs`` predefined template variable again (as
  far as ``chameleon`` allows it)
  (`#860 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/860>`_).

- Improve documentation of ``CONTEXTS`` in the "Zope Book".

- Update dependencies to the latest releases that still support Python 2.


4.4.4 (2020-06-26)
------------------

- Decrease cookie size for copy/paste clipboard cookie
  (`#854 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/854>`_)

4.4.3 (2020-06-16)
------------------

- Fix parsing of package version and show correct major version in the ZMI.

- Improve solidity of the ``debugError`` method.
  (`#829 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/829>`_)

- Use ``Chameleon`` (>= 3.7.2) configuration to get better
  information for errors detected during template execution.
  (`#837 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/837>`_)

4.4 (2020-03-31)
----------------

- Fix incompatiblities with ``Archetypes``

- Fix issue 717 by fully honoring the engine returned by
  ``PageTemplate.pt_getEngine``
  (`#717 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/717>`_).
  The engine also decides about the use of ``zope.tales``
  (engine is an instance of ``zope.pagetemplate.engine.ZopeBaseEngine``)
  or ``chameleon.tales`` (otherwise) TALES expressions.

- Fixed encoding issue of `displayname` WebDAV property
  (`#797 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/797>`_)

- Fixed fallback implementation of ``manage_DAVget``
  (`#799 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/799>`_)

----------------

- Enable WebDAV support independent of ``ZServer``
  (`#787 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/787>`_)

- Only use ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` for response bodies with a ``read`` method
  (`#763 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/763>`_)

- Fix sort link URLs on ``manage_main``
  (`#748 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/748>`_)

- Fix longstanding test bug by forcing the page template engine.
  Many tests in ``Products.PageTemplates`` used the old Zope page template
  engine because the correct one was not registered during setup.

- Add deprecation warnings to the ``ZPublisher.maybe_lock`` module
  (`#758 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/758>`_)

- Add deprecation warnings to Help System-related methods
  (`#756 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/756>`_)

- Update to current releases of the dependencies

  (`#740 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/740>`_)

- Add ``Paste`` as ``extras_require`` dependency to pull in ``Paste`` when
  installing with `pip` and `constraints.txt` to prevent startup errors.
  This requires adding the ``[wsgi]`` extra in the egg specification.
  (`#734 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/734>`_)

- Fix broken deprecated import when ZServer is not installed
  (`#714 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/714>`_)

------------------

- Resurrect ZMI History tab and functionality.

- Remove commented out configuration for ``tempstorage`` (and server side
  sessions) as that was known not working for ages. This was removed so we do
  not lead unsuspecting developers to think that this is the right way to do
  session data. See
  (`#679 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/679>`_)
  (`tempstorage#8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/issues/8>`_)

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- Update ZODB migration documentation.

  (`#571 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/571>`_)

- Make Zope write a PID file again under WSGI.
  This makes interaction with sysadmin tools easier.
  The PID file path can be set in the Zope configuration with ``pid-filename``,
  just like in ``ZServer``-based configurations.

- Exceptions during publishing are now re-raised in a new exceptions debug
  mode to allow WSGI middleware to handle/debug it. See the `debug

4.0b1 (2017-09-15)
------------------

With this release the egg of the project is named `Zope` instead of `Zope2`.
There is a meta package named `Zope2` which depends on `Zope`.

See https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WHATSNEW.html for a higher level
description of the changes.

Supported versions
++++++++++++++++++

- Add support for Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

- Drop support for Python 2.6.

Breaking changes
++++++++++++++++

- Removed the old help system, in favor of the current Sphinx documentation
  hosted at https://zope.readthedocs.io/. For backwards compatibility the
  `registerHelp` and `registerHelpTitle` methods are still available on the
  ProductContext used during the `initialize` function.

- Remove ZMI re-ordering features.

- Retired icons from the `Zope Management Interface` and various smaller
  cleanups of ZMI screens.

- Remove xml-export.

- Remove `Globals` package, opened database are now found in
  `Zope2.opened` next to `Zope2.DB`.

- Remove proxy role support from DTML documents and methods.

- Removed `AccessRule` and `SiteRoot` from `Products.SiteAccess`.

- Remove `Products.ZReST` and the `reStructuredText` wrapper, you can use
  `docutils` directly to gain `reST` support.

- Stop setting ``CLIENT_HOME`` as a builtin, get it via
  ``App.config.getConfiguration().clienthome`` instead.

- Drop ``OFS.History`` functionality.

- Removed ``OFS.DefaultObservable`` - an early predecessor of `zope.event`.

- Removed ``OFS.ZDOM``. `OFS.SimpleItem.Item` now implements `getParentNode()`.

- Removed special code to create user folders and page templates while creating
  new ``OFS.Folder`` instances.

- Removed the `App.version_txt.getZopeVersion` API, you can use
  ``pkg_resources.get_distribution('Zope').version`` instead.

- On the application object, removed `PrincipiaTime` in favor of `ZopeTime` and
  `PrincipiaRedirect` in favor of `Redirect` or `ZopeRedirect`.

- Removed `bobobase_modification_time` from `Persistence.Persistent`, you can
  use `DateTime(object._p_mtime)` instead.

- Removed the special handling of `Set-Cookie` headers in
  `HTTPResponse.setHeader`. Use the `setCookie`/`appendCookie`/`expireCookie`
  methods instead, or if low-level control is needed, use `addHeader` instead
  to get the exact same effect.

- Raise ``BadRequest`` instead of returning MessageDialog.

- Update available HTTP response code, 302 is now called ``Found``.

- Refactor ``browser:view`` and ``browser:page`` directives.
  This makes their implementation more similar to that in ``zope.browserpage``
  and adds allowed_interface support for the ``browser:view`` directive.
  By default the `aq_*` attributes are no longer available on those
  views/pages.

- Removed the last remaining code to support `SOFTWARE_HOME` and `ZOPE_HOME`.

- Simplified instance skeleton, removing old `Extensions`, `import`,
  `lib/python` and `Products` from the default. You can continue to manually
  add these back. (`Products` requires `ZServer` to be usable.)

- Remove the `zopectl` script.

WSGI
++++

- Document running Zope as a WSGI application.

- Remove `Connection` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers from WSGI responses.
  According to PEP 333 WSGI applications must not emit hop-by-hop headers.

- Ensure that the ``WSGIPublisher`` begins and ends an *interaction*
  at the request/response barrier. This is required for instance for
  the ``checkPermission`` call to function without an explicit
  ``interaction`` parameter.

- Make the WSGIPublisher normalize HTTP exception classes based on name
  (for example, any exception named NotFound will be converted
  into `zExceptions.NotFound`). This restores compatibility with
  similar behavior of the old publisher.

- Change the WSGIResponse exception methods to raise exceptions instead
  of returning responses. This includes ``notFoundError``, ``forbiddenError``,
  ``debugError``, ``badRequestError`` and ``unauthorized``.

- Add support for exception views to WSGIPublisher.

- Add support for ``ConflictError`` and ``TransientError`` retry logic directly
  into WSGIPublisher, thus `repoze.tm2` and `repoze.retry` are no longer
  needed and no longer supported.

- Change Testing to use the WSGI publisher for functional and testbrowser
  based tests incl. functional doctests. Alternatives are available
  in ``ZServer.Testing``.

- Split a WSGI part out of `Zope2.Startup.ZopeStarter`.

- Include ``waitress`` as a default WSGI app server.

- Add `egg:Zope#httpexceptions` WSGI middleware.

- Add a new `runwsgi` script to serve PasteDeploy files.


ZODB
++++

- Support ZODB 5.

- Removed persistent default content like `standard_error_message`,
  `error_log`, `temp_folder` and `index_html`.


Control panel
+++++++++++++

- Removed ZMI controls for restarting the process, these no longer apply when
  managed as a WSGI application.

- Remove `DebugInfo` and `DavLocks` from control panel.

- Move the undo management to Control Panel -> Databases -> Database -> Undo.

- Simplify ZMI control panel and globally available management screens.

- Remove `control panel` object from the ZODB, it is no longer persistent.


ZServer
+++++++

- Split out ``Lifetime``, ``webdav`` and ``ZServer`` packages into a `ZServer`
  project.

- Move ``EtagSupport``, ``Lockable`` and ``LockItem`` from ``webdav`` into
  `OFS`.

- Move ``ZPublisher.Publish`` module into `ZServer` distribution.

- Move ``Products.SiteAccess`` into `ZServer` distribution.

- Move ZServer related testing support into ``ZServer.Testing``.

zope.conf
+++++++++

- Always configure a `blob-dir` in the default skeleton.

- Removed `mime-types` option from `zope.conf`. You can use the `add_files`
  API from `zope.contenttype` instead.

- Removed various persistent product related code and options.

- Split a WSGI part out of `zopeschema.xml`. This reduces the supported
  `zope.conf` directives when run under WSGI. If a directive is now unkown
  it might have been moved to the `ZServer` package.
  See https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZServer/blob/master/src/ZServer/Zope2/Startup/zopeschema.xml
  for the directives which are supported via `ZServer`.

- Remove profiling support via `publisher-profile-file` directive.

- Changed the value for ``default-zpublisher-encoding`` to ``utf-8``.
  If you set a different value for ``management_page_charset`` consider
  changing ``default-zpublisher-encoding`` now.

- Removed the ``enable-ms-author-via`` directive which was only required for
  very old web folder implementations from before 2007.

- Changed `zope.conf` default settings for ``python-check-interval`` to ``1000``.

Dependencies
++++++++++++

- Integrate code from and drop dependency on `five.globalrequest`.

- Integrate `five.pt` code directly into `Products.PageTemplates`.

- Drop `ZopeUndo` dependency.

- Remove `Products.StandardCacheManagers` dependency.

- Remove dependency on `initgroups`. Use the standard libraries
  ``os.initgroups`` instead.

- Merge `Products.OFSP` project back in.

- `Products.SiteErrorLog` is now a separated package and Zope no longer depends
  on it.

- Split `Products.TemporaryFolder` and `Products.ZODBMountPoint` into
  one new project called `Products.TemporaryFolder`.

- Create new `Products.Sessions` distribution including ``Products.Sessions``
  and ``Products.Transience`` code.

- Dropped the direct dependencies on packages that have been factored out of
  the main Zope 2 tree. Make sure you declare a dependency in your own
  distribution if you still use one of these:

    - `Products.BTreeFolder2`
    - `Products.ExternalMethod`
    - `Products.MailHost`
    - `Products.MIMETools`
    - `Products.PythonScripts`
    - `Products.SiteErrorLog`
    - `Products.StandardCacheManagers`
    - `Products.ZCatalog`
    - `Record`

Deprecations
++++++++++++

- Five.browser: Marked `processInputs` and `setPageEncoding` as deprecated.
  `processInputs` was replaced by the `postProcessInputs` request method and
  the charset negotiation done by `setPageEncoding` was never fully supported.

New features
++++++++++++

- Add support to SameSite cookie in ``ZPublisher.HTTPBaseResponse``:
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07

- Optimized the `OFS.ObjectManager.__contains__` method to do the
  least amount of work necessary.

- Optimized the `OFS.Traversable.getPhysicalPath` method to avoid excessive
  amounts of method calls.

- During startup open a connection to every configured database, to ensure all
  of them can indeed be accessed. This avoids surprises during runtime when
  traversal to some database mountpoint could fail as the underlying storage
  cannot be opened at all.

- Explicitly close all databases on shutdown, which ensures `Data.fs.index`
  gets written to the file system.

- ZPublisher: If `IBrowserPage` is provided by a view, form input is decoded.
  This makes it easier to use ``zope.formlib`` and ``z3c.form`` in Zope 2.

Security fixes
++++++++++++++

- Fix reflective XSS in findResult.

- Patch zope.interface to remove docstrings and avoid publishing.

- Don't copy items the user is not allowed to view.

- Quote variable in manage_tabs to avoid XSS.

- Removed docstrings from some methods to avoid publishing them.

- Ensure that Request objects cannot be published / traversed
  directly via a URL.
  (`LP #789863 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/789863>`_)


- Port tests for ``str.format`` security fix from Zope 2.13.

Bugfixes
++++++++

- PropertyManagers and PropertySheets now correctly accept all forms of
  strings as property values.

- Allow handling of multipart requests in functional doctests using ``http``.

- Fix Content-Length header for non-ascii responses incl. a base tag.

- bobo_traverse of ProductDispatcher did not correctly invalidate cache
  when a product was not initializes after first access of the cache. Types
  that were added in test-profiles were not useable.

- Prevent leaked connections when broken ``EndRequestEvent``
  subscribers raise exceptions.
  (`#16 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/16>`_)

- Made sure ``getConfiguration().default_zpublisher_encoding`` is set correctly.

- Fix publishing of ``IStreamIterator``. This interface does
  not have seek or tell.  Introduce ``IUnboundStreamIterator`` to support
  publishing iterators of unknown length.
  (`#28 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/28>`_)

- Removed the (very obsolete) thread lock around the cookie parsing code
  in HTTPRequest.py; the python `re` module is thread-safe, unlike the

  - zExceptions = 3.3
  - ZServer = 4.0a1

Restructuring
+++++++++++++

- Change the WSGIResponse exception methods to raise exceptions instead
  of returning responses. This includes notFoundError, forbiddenError,
  debugError, badRequestError, unauthorized and redirect.

  WSGIResponse. Move ZServer specific logic onto HTTPResponse.

- Simplified `ZPublisher.WSGIPublisher.get_module_info` contract.

- Add new `ZPublisher.utils.recordMetaData` function and use default
  `transaction.manager` as the transaction manager.

- Remove support for repoze.tm2.

- Change Testing to use the WSGI publisher for functional and testbrowser
  based tests incl. functional doctests. Alternatives are available
  in `ZServer.Testing`.

- Split `Products.TemporaryFolder` and `Products.ZODBMountPoint` into
  one new project called `Products.TemporaryFolder`.

- Split a WSGI part out of `zopeschema.xml`. This reduces the supported
  `zope.conf` directives when run under WSGI.

- Remove temp_folder mount point from default configuration.

- Split a WSGI part out of `Zope2.Startup.ZopeStarter`.

- Add new `ZServer.Zope2.Startup.config` module to hold configuration.

    ``zope.structuredtext``


4.0a1 (2016-07-22)
------------------

Bugs Fixed
++++++++++

- Remove `Connection` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers from WSGI responses.
  According to PEP 333 WSGI applications must not emit hop-by-hop headers.

- Removed docstrings from some methods to avoid publishing them.  From
  Products.PloneHotfix20160419.  [maurits]

- bobo_traverse of ProductDispatcher did not correctly invalidate cache
  when a product was not initializes after first access of the cache. Types
  that were added in test-profiles were not useable.
  [pbauer, jensens]

- Fix pt_editForm after the help-system was removed.
  [pbauer]

- Skipped ipv6 test on Travis, because Travis no longer supports this.

- LP #789863:  Ensure that Request objects cannot be published / traversed
  directly via a URL.

- Document running Zope as a WSGI application.

- Queue additional warning filters at the beginning of the queue in order to
  allow overrides.

- Issue #16: prevent leaked connections when broken ``EndRequestEvent``
  subscribers raise exceptions.

- Ensure that the ``WSGIPublisher`` begins and ends an *interaction*
  at the request/response barrier. This is required for instance for
  the ``checkPermission`` call to function without an explicit
  ``interaction`` parameter.

- Made sure getConfiguration().default_zpublisher_encoding is set correctly.

- Issue #28: Fix publishing of IStreamIterator. This interface does
  not have seek or tell.
  Introduce IUnboundStreamIterator to support publishing iterators
  of unknown length.


Features Added
++++++++++++++

- Include waitress as a default WSGI app server.

- Add `egg:Zope2#httpexceptions` WSGI middleware.

- Update available HTTP response code, 302 is now called Found.

- Add a new `runwsgi` script to serve PasteDeploy files.

- Depend on and automatically set up `five.globalrequest`.

- Optimized the `OFS.ObjectManager.__contains__` method to do the
  least amount of work necessary.

- Optimized the `OFS.Traversable.getPhysicalPath` method to avoid excessive
  amounts of method calls.

- During startup open a connection to every configured database, to ensure all
  of them can indeed be accessed. This avoids surprises during runtime when
  traversal to some database mountpoint could fail as the underlying storage
  cannot be opened at all.

- Explicitly close all databases on shutdown, which ensures `Data.fs.index`
  gets written to the file system.

- Always configure a `blob-dir` in the default skeleton.

- ZPublisher: If `IBrowserPage` is provided by a view, form input is decoded.
  This makes it easier to use ``zope.formlib`` and ``z3c.form`` in Zope 2.

- Remove `control panel` object from the ZODB.

- Updated to latest versions of Zope Toolkit libraries.

- Updated distributions:

  - AccessControl = 4.0a1
  - Acquisition = 4.2.2
  - BTrees = 4.0.8
  - DateTime = 4.1.1
  - ExtensionClass = 4.1.2
  - docutils = 0.9.1
  - five.globalrequest = 1.0
  - manuel = 1.6.0
  - Missing = 3.1
  - MultiMapping = 3.0
  - Persistence = 3.0a1
  - Products.BTreeFolder2 = 3.0
  - Products.ExternalMethod = 3.0
  - Products.MailHost = 3.0
  - Products.OFSP = 3.0
  - Products.PythonScripts = 3.0
  - Products.SiteErrorLog = 4.0
  - Products.StandardCacheManagers = 3.0
  - Products.ZCatalog = 4.0a1
  - Products.ZCTextIndex = 3.0
  - Record = 3.1
  - tempstorage = 3.0
  - zExceptions = 3.0
  - zLOG = 3.0
  - zope.globalrequest = 1.2
  - ZopeUndo = 4.1

Restructuring
+++++++++++++

- Remove dependency on initgroups. Use the standard libraries os.initgroups
  instead.

- Removed nt_svcutils support from zopectl.

- Python 2.6 is no longer supported. Use Python 2.7.

- Products.SiteErrorLog: Is now a separated package.

- OFS: Removed duplicate code in ZopeFind and ZopeFindAndApply

- Five: Removed obsolete metaclass.

- Five: Refactored ``browser:view`` and ``browser:page`` directives.
  This makes their implementation more similar to that in ``zope.browserpage``
  and adds allowed_interface support for the ``browser:view`` directive.
  By default the `aq_*` attributes are no longer available on those
  views/pages. If you still use them, you have to mix in Five's BrowserView.

- Removed the (very obsolete) thread lock around the cookie parsing code
  in HTTPRequest.py; the python `re` module is thread-safe, unlike the
  ancient `regex` module that was once used here.

- Removed the special handling of `Set-Cookie` headers in
  `HTTPResponse.setHeader`. Use the `setCookie`/`appendCookie`/`expireCookie`
  methods instead, or if low-level control is needed, use `addHeader` instead
  to get the exact same effect.

- Removed the `App.version_txt.getZopeVersion` API, you can use
  ``pkg_resources.get_distribution('Zope2').version`` instead.

- On the application object, removed `PrincipiaTime` in favor of `ZopeTime` and
  `PrincipiaRedirect` in favor of `Redirect` or `ZopeRedirect`.

- Removed `OFS.DefaultObservable` - an early predecessor of `zope.event`.

- Removed `mime-types` option from `zope.conf`. You can use the `add_files`
  API from `zope.contenttype` instead.

- Removed `OFS.ZDOM`. `OFS.SimpleItem.Item` now implements `getParentNode()`.

- Removed the last remaining code to support `SOFTWARE_HOME` and `ZOPE_HOME`.

- Removed ZMI controls for restarting the process, these no longer apply when
  managed as a WSGI application.

- Removed `bobobase_modification_time` from `Persistence.Persistent`, you can
  use `DateTime(object._p_mtime)` instead.

- Removed `AccessRule` and `SiteRoot` from `Products.SiteAccess`.

- Removed `Products.ZReST` and the `reStructuredText` wrapper, you can use
  `docutils` directly to gain `reST` support.

- Removed special code to create user folders and page templates while creating
  new `OFS.Folder` instances.

- Removed persistent default code like the `error_log` and `temp_folder`.

- Removed persistent default content, including the `standard_error_message`
  template.

- Retired icons from the `Zope Management Interface` and various smaller
  cleanups of ZMI screens.

- Removed the old help system, in favor of the current Sphinx documentation
  hosted at https://zope.readthedocs.io/. For backwards compatibility the
  `registerHelp` and `registerHelpTitle` methods are still available on the
  ProductContext used during the `initialize` function.

- Removed various persistent product related code and options. The
  `enable-product-installation` `zope.conf` setting is now a no-op.

- Changed the value for `default-zpublisher-encoding` and
  `management_page_charset` to `utf-8`.

- Removed the `enable-ms-author-via` directive which was only required for
  very old web folder implementations from before 2007.

- Changed zope.conf default settings for `zserver-threads` to `2` and
  `python-check-interval` to `1000`.

- Simplified instance skeleton, removing old `Extensions`, `import`,
  `lib/python` and `Products` from the default. You can continue to manually
  add these back.

- Five.browser: Marked `processInputs` and `setPageEncoding` as deprecated.
  `processInputs` was replaced by the `postProcessInputs` request method and
  the charset negotiation done by `setPageEncoding` was never fully supported.

- Dropped the direct dependencies on packages that have been factored out of
  the main Zope 2 tree. Make sure you declare a dependency in your own
  distribution if you still use one of these:

    ``Products.BTreeFolder2``
    ``Products.ExternalMethod``
    ``Products.MailHost``
    ``Products.MIMETools``
    ``Products.PythonScripts``
    ``Products.SiteErrorLog``
    ``Products.StandardCacheManagers``
    ``Products.ZCatalog``
    ``Record``
