5.8.6 (2023-10-04)
------------------

- Make sure the object title in the ZMI breadcrumbs is quoted
  to prevent a cross-site scripting issue.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Base the inline/attachment logic developed for CVE-2023-42458
  on the media type proper (ignore parameters and
  whitespace and normalize to lowercase)
  (`#1167 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1167>`_).


5.8.5 (2023-09-21)
------------------

- Allow only some image types to be displayed inline. Force download for
  others, especially SVG images.  By default we use a list of allowed types.
  You can switch a to a list of denied types by setting OS environment variable
  ``OFS_IMAGE_USE_DENYLIST=1``.  You can override the allowed list with
  environment variable ``ALLOWED_INLINE_MIMETYPES`` and the disallowed list
  with ``DISALLOWED_INLINE_MIMETYPES``.  Separate multiple entries by either
  comma or space.  This change only affects direct URL access.
  ``<img src="image.svg" />`` works the same as before. (CVE-2023-42458)
  See `security advisory <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v>`_.

- Tighten down the ZMI frame source logic to only allow site-local sources.

5.8.4 (2023-09-06)
------------------

- Disable a ``ZCatalog`` (more precisly: ``Products.PluginIndexes``)
  performance test which occasionally fails on GitHub.
  For details, see
  `#1136 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1136>`_.

- Restore filename on code objects of objects returned from
  ``App.Extensions.getObject()``. This got lost in 4.0a6.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Add preliminary support for Python 3.12rc1.

- Make ``mapply`` ``__signature__`` aware.
  This allows to publish methods decorated via a decorator
  which sets ``__signature__`` on the wrapper to specify
  the signature to use.
  For details, see
  `#1134 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1134>`_.
  Note: ``mapply`` still does not support keyword only, var positional
  and var keyword parameters.

- Make Zope's parameters for denial of service protection configurable
  `#1141 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1141>`_.

- Update ``RestrictedPython`` to version 6.2 to mitigate a security problem.
  (CVE-2023-41039)

- Fix adding Page Templates without valid file input from the ZMI
  (`#1130 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1130>`_)

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.


5.8.2 (2023-05-22)
------------------

- Allow ``ZPublisher`` to handle both a query string and a request body;
  the request parameters from the query string are made available
  in the request attribute ``form`` (a ``dict``),
  the request body can be accessed via the request keys ``BODY``
  (a ``bytes`` object) or ``BODYFILE`` (a file like object).
  Fixes `#1122 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1122>`_.

- Support access to the request's ``BODY`` key for WSGI servers
  which hand over an unseekable request body (such as e.g.
  ``Gunicorn``).
  Fixes `#1125 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1125>`_.

- Do not break on GET requests that pass a query string
  and a `Content-Type` header.
  For details see `#1117 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1117>`_.

- Implement code change suggestions from CodeQL scanning.

- Added Japanese translations for some Sphinx docs
  (`#1109 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1109>`_)

  See `#1094 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1094>`_.

- Clean out and refactor dependency configuration files.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Support the (non standard) ``charset`` parameter for
  content type ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``.
  This is required (e.g. for ``Plone``) because
  ``jquery`` constructs content types of the form
  ```application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8``.
  For details see
  `plone/buildout.coredev#844
  <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev/pull/844>`_.


5.8 (2023-01-10)

5.7.3 (2022-12-19)
------------------

- Explicitly serve ``App.Dialogs.MessageDialog`` and exception views as HTML
  due to the changed default content type from `#1075
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1075>`_.


5.7.2 (2022-12-17)
------------------

- Fix some broken ZMI pages due to the changed default content type
  from PR https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1075
  (`#1078 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1078>`_)

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.


5.7.1 (2022-12-16)
------------------

- Set the published default ``Content-Type`` header to ``text/plain``
  if none has been set explicitly to prevent a cross-site scripting attack.
  Also remove the old behavior of constructing an HTML page for published
  methods returning a two-item tuple.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.


5.7 (2022-11-17)
----------------

- Script `addzopeuser` accepts now parameter '-c' or '--configuration'.
  This allows passing in a custom location for the `zope.conf` file to use.
  If not specified, behavior is not altered.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Change functional testing utilities to support percent encoded and unicode
  paths (`#1058 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1058>`_).

- Decode basic authentication header as utf-8, not latin1 anymore
  (`#1061 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1061>`_).

  as described in `RFC7617 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpauth-basicauth-update-07#section-2.1>`_
  ( `#1065 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1065>`_).

- Added `:json` converter in `ZPublisher.Converters`.
  (`#957 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/957>`_)

- Support Python 3.11.


5.6 (2022-09-09)
----------------

- Make Products.PageTemplate engine compatible with Chameleon 3.10.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Start work on Python 3.11 support, which will arrive in a later release.

- Fix cookie path parameter handling:
  If the cookie path value contains ``%`` it is assumed to be
  fully quoted and used as is;
  if it contains only characters allowed (unquoted)
  in an URL path (with the exception of ``;``),
  it is used as is; otherwise, it is quoted using Python's
  ``urllib.parse.quote``
  (`#1052 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1052>`_).


5.5.2 (2022-06-28)
------------------

- Update ``waitress`` to version 2.1.2.

- Improvements on find_bad_templates(): check Filesystem Page
  Templates too and show html tags in web report
  (`#1042 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1042>`_)

- Fix version pin specifications for Python 3.6 compatibility.
  (`#1036 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1036>`_)

- Quote all components of a redirect URL (not only the path component)
  (`#1027 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1027>`_)

  in order to get rid of a lot of dependency version pins.
  These were only needed for maintainers who can install them manually.
  (`#1019 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1019>`_)

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Modify "manage_access" to allow users to switch from the compact view
  to the complete matrix view when more than 30 roles are defined.

- Strip leading ``.`` in cookie domain names.
  (`#1041 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/1041>`_)


5.5.1 (2022-04-05)
------------------

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.

- Update ``waitress`` to version 2.1.1 to mitigate a vulnerability in that
  package. As ``waitress`` no longer supports Python 3.6 it is not advised
  to run Zope on Python 3.6 any longer even though it still supports Python
  3.6. **Due to this security issue support for Python 3.6 is now officially
  deprecated. It will be removed with Zope version 5.7.**

- To run ``bin/buildout`` inside the Zope project now ``zc.buildout >= 2.13.7``

  indicated differently by the content type.
  (`#1006 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/1006>`_)

- Use ``zc.buildout 3.0rc2`` to install Zope to run its tests.


5.4 (2022-01-09)
----------------

- Audit and fix all hyperlinks in code and documentation

  - Change zope.org references to zope.dev due to ongoing domain ownership
    issues. zope.dev is owned by the Plone Foundation and thus safe from
    interference. XML/ZCML namespace URLs remain unchanged.
  - Remove all links that are completely dead, such as the old zope.org
    Collectors issue trackers.
  - Update all other miscellaneous links to make them work again or remove if
    the information is gone.

- Improve type guessing for the default WebDAV PUT factory
  (`#997 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/997>`_)

- Enable WebDAV PUT factories to change a newly created object's ID
  (`#997 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/997>`_)

- Fix potential race condition in ``App.version_txt.getZopeVersion``
  (`#999 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/999>`_)

  This makes the Add forms work again with the ZPublisher converter code
  changes.

- Remove deprecated ulines, utext, utokens, ustring from more code.
  In the properties form, show a deprecation warning.

- Add function ``ZPublisher.utils.fix_properties``.
  You can call this to fix lines properties to only contain strings, not bytes.
  It also replaces the deprecated property types ulines, utext, utoken, and
  ustring with their non-unicode variants.
  (`#987 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/987>`_)

- Add support for Python 3.10.

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.


5.3 (2021-07-31)

- Reinstate simple sessioning with ``Products.TemporaryFolder``
  because the underlying issues with ``tempstorage`` have been fixed.
  (`#985 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/985>`_)

- Update the ``AccessControl`` version pin to fix a remote code execution issue
  (see `AccessControl security advisory GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf>`_)

- Prevent ``DeprecationWarnings`` from moved imports in ``AccessControl``

- make sure "Manager" users can always modify proxy roles
  (`see Products.PythonScripts#50
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.PythonScripts/issues/50>`_)

- Deprecate usage of "unicode" converters. Also, the behavior of
  ``field2lines`` is now aligned to the other converters and returns a list of
  strings instead of a list of bytes.
  (`#962 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/962>`_)

- Update to newest compatible versions of dependencies.


5.2.1 (2021-06-08)

- Updated/fixed the poll application tutorial in the Zope Developers Guide
  (`#958 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/958>`_)

- Update to newest versions of dependencies.

- Depend on ``zope.datetime`` for the functions ``iso8601_date``,
  ``rfc850_date``, and ``rfc1123_date`` which used to be in ``App.Common``
  keeping backwards-compatibility imports in place.

Backwards incompatible changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- With the exception of ``field2bytes``, field converters do no longer try to
  read file like objects
  (`#558 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/558>`_)

------------------

- Enforce Zope permissions during recursive XML-RPC data dumps
  (`#954 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/954>`_)

- The ``compute_size`` method properly returns None if the content does not
  have a ``get_size`` method but the parent has.
  (`#948 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/948>`_)

----------------

Backwards incompatible changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Exclude characters special for ``chameleon``'s interpolation syntax
  (i.e. ``${}``) from use in TALES path expressions to reduce the failure risk
  for the ``chameleon`` interpolation heuristics
  (`#925 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/925>`_)

Features
++++++++

- Restore the ZMI `Debug Information` control panel page
  (`#898 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/898>`_)

Fixes
+++++

- Fix ZMI visibility of pre elements in error log
  (`Products.SiteErrorLog#26
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.SiteErrorLog/issues/26>`_)

- Fix ``length`` for page template repeat variables
  (`#913 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/913>`_)

- Update `isort` to version 5.
  (`#892 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/892>`_)

5.0 (2020-10-08)
----------------

Backwards incompatible changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Drop support for Python 3.5 as it will run out of support soon.
  (`#841 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/841>`_)


Features
++++++++

- HTTP header encoding support
  (`#905 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/905>`_)

- Add support for Python 3.9.

- New interface ``Products.PageTemplates.interfaces.IZopeAwareEngine``.
  It can be used as the "provides" of an adapter registration
  to adapt a non ``Zope`` tales engine to an engine to be used
  by ``Zope`` page templates
  (`#864 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/864>`_).
  Currently, the adaptation is used only when the
  template is rendered with ``chameleon``;
  with ``zope.pagetemplate``, the engine is used
  as is - this may change in the future.

- Allow (some) builtins as first element of a (TALES) path expression:
  in an untrusted context, the builtins from
  ``AccessControl.safe_builtins`` are allowed;
  in a trusted context, all Python builtins are allowed in addition
  (and take precedence)
  (`zope.tales#23 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.tales/issues/23>`_).

- Support the ``attrs`` predefined template variable again (as
  far as ``chameleon`` allows it)
  (`#860 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/860>`_).

- Use ``Chameleon`` (>= 3.7.2) configuration to get better
  information for errors detected during template execution
  (`#837 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/837>`_).

Fixes
+++++

- Provide a more senseful ``OFS.SimpleItem.Item_w__name__.id``
  to avoid bugs by use of deprecated direct ``id`` access
  (as e.g. (`#903 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/903>`_).

- Update to ``zope.interface > 5.1.0`` to fix a memory leak.

- Fix export of files with non-latin-1 compatible names
  (`#890 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/890>`_)

- Avoid unsolicited translations
  (`#876 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/876>`_)

- Make "chameleon-zope context wrapping" more faithful.
  (`#873 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/873/files>`_)

- Let "unicode conflict resolution" work for all templates (not just
  ``ZopePageTemplate``).
  (`#872 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/872/files>`_)

- Make "Unicode Conflict Resolution" available for templates
  rendered with ``chameleon``
  (`Products.CMFPlone#3145
  <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3145>`_).

- Improve documentation of ``CONTEXTS`` in the "Zope Book".

- Decrease cookie size for copy/paste clipboard cookie
  (`#854 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/854>`_)

- Fix ``default`` keyword handling in page templates
  (`#846 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/846>`_)

- Fix parsing of package version and show correct major version in the ZMI

- Improve solidity of the ``debugError`` method.
  (`#829 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/829>`_)

- Fix that ``ZTUtils.LazyFilter`` could not be imported inside a restricted
  Python script.
  (`#901 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/901>`_)

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- Add ``pyupgrade`` via ``pre-commit``
  (`#859 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/859>`_)

- Add ``tal:switch`` test


5.0a2 (2020-04-24)
------------------

Bug fixes
+++++++++

- Pin ``AccessControl`` 4.2 for the `Manage WebDAV Locks` permission

- Fix ``HEAD`` requests on registered views
  (`#816 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/816>`_)

- Improve ``chameleon`` --> ``zope.tales`` context wrapper
  (support for template variable injection)
  (`#812 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/812>`_).

- Require ``zope.tales>=5.0.2``

- Fix issue 717 by fully honoring the engine returned by
  ``PageTemplate.pt_getEngine``
  (`#717 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/717>`_).
  The engine also decides about the use of ``zope.tales``
  (engine is an instance of ``zope.pagetemplate.engine.ZopeBaseEngine``)
  or ``chameleon.tales`` (otherwise) TALES expressions.

- Fixed encoding issue of `displayname` WebDAV property
  (`#797 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/issues/797>`_)
