class ZSQLMethod:
    """

    ZSQLMethods abstract SQL code in Zope.

    They support three important abstractions:

      - Method

        SQL Methods behave like methods of the folders they are
        accessed in.  In particular, they can be used from other
        methods, like Documents, ExternalMethods, and even other SQL
        Methods.

      - Searchability

        Database methods support the Searchable Object Interface.
        Search interface wizards can be used to build user
        interfaces to them.  They can be used in joins and
        unions. They provide meta-data about their input parameters
        and result data.

        For more information, see the searchable-object interface
        specification. 

      - Containment

        Database methods support URL traversal to access and invoke
        methods on individual record objects. For example, suppose you
        had an 'employees' database method that took a single argument
        'employee_id'.  Suppose that employees had a 'service_record'
        method (defined in a record class or acquired from a
        folder). The 'service_record' method could be accessed with a
        URL like::

           employees/employee_id/1234/service_record

    """


    def __call__(self, REQUEST=None, **kw):
        """

        Call the ZSQLMethod.

        The arguments to the method should be passed via keyword
        arguments, or in a single mapping object. If no arguments are
        given, and if the method was invoked through the Web, then the
        method will try to acquire and use the Web REQUEST object as
        the argument mapping.

        The returned value is a sequence of record objects.

        """
    

    def manage_edit(self,title,connection_id,arguments,template):
        """

        Change database method properties.

        The 'connection_id' argument is the id of a database
        connection that resides in the current folder or in a folder
        above the current folder.  The database should understand SQL.

        The 'arguments' argument is a string containing an arguments
        specification, as would be given in the SQL method cration
        form.

        The 'template' argument is a string containing the source for
        the SQL Template.
