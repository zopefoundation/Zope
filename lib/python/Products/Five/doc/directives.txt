=================================
ZCML Directives supported by Five
=================================

Five tries to use the Zope 3 ZCML directives where possible, though
does sometimes subset the possible attributes. It also introduces a
few directives of its own under the ``five`` namespace.

Directives are listed per namespace, in alphabetic order.

zope ``http://namespaces.zope.org/zope``
========================================

adapter
-------

Hook an adapter factory to an interface.

content
-------

Declare interface and permissions on content object. Declares Zope 2
permissions.

permission
----------

Way to make Zope 2 permissions available to Five, ``title`` is
permission name.

redefinePermission
------------------

Redefine a permission in included ZCML as another one.

skin
----

Declare a skin, consisting of layers.

utility
-------

Declare a global utility.

interface
---------

Register an interface in ZCML.

factory
-------

Register an object factory.

modulealias
-----------

Provide a module under an alias name, e.g. for persistent backward
compatability.

hook
----

Install a hook on a hookable object.

browser ``http://namespaces.zope.org/browser``
==============================================

page
----

Declare a page view for an interface. Permission is a Zope 2
permission.

pages
-----

Declare multiple page views for an interface. Permissions are Zope 2
permissions.

defaultView
-----------

Declare the name of the view that should be used for the default when viewing
the object; i.e. when the object is traversed to without a view.

defaultSkin
-----------

Declare the default skin used.

editform
--------

Create an edit form based on a schema.

addform
--------

Create an add form based on a schema.

layer
-----

Declare a layer.

menu
----

Declare a menu

menuItem, menuItems
-------------------

Declare menuItems

five ``http://namespaces.zope.org/five``
========================================

implements
----------

Make a class declare it implements an interface.

loadProducts
------------

Loads ZCML in all Zope 2 products. First processes all ``meta.zcml``
files, then processes all ``configure.zcml`` files.

loadProductsOverrides
---------------------

Loads overriding ZCML in all products (``overrides.zcml``).

traversable
-----------

This statement is now deprecated, since the functionality now is on Zope Core.

Make a Zope 2 content class traversable in the Zope 3 manner using
Five. This is used to attached views, resources and other things to
Zope 2 objects.

defaultViewable
---------------

This statement is now deprecated, since the functionality now is on Zope Core.

Make a Zope 2 content class use a Zope 3 default view when looking at
it without any paths appended to it. This works then instead of
``index_html`` in Zope 2.

sizable
-------

Retrieve size information for a Zope 2 content class via a Zope 3
style ``ISized`` adapter.

containerEvents
---------------

Make events be sent for Zope 2 container objects, instead of calling old
methods like ``manage_afterAdd``. These old methods will still be called
for classes specified in a ``deprecatedManageAddDelete`` directive.

deprecatedManageAddDelete
-------------------------

Specify a class that needs its old deprecated methods like
``manage_afterAdd``, ``manage_beforeDelete`` and ``manage_afterClone``
to be called. Modern classes should use event subscribers instead.

pagesFromDirectory
------------------

Loads all files with .pt extension in a directory as pages.

registerClass
-------------

Registers Five content with Zope 2.

localsite
---------

Turns a class into an implementation of ``IPossibleSite`` so that its
instances can be serve as local sites.  Unless otherwise specified, a
default implementation's methods will be used to make the class comply
with the ``IPossibleSite`` interface.
