TAL - Template Attribute Language
---------------------------------

This is a prototype implementation of TAL, the Zope Template Attribute
Language.  For TAL, see the Zope Presentation Templates ZWiki:

    http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/FrontPage

It is not yet a Zope product nor is it intended to run inside of Zope,
but you must have a Zope checkout to access the DOM implementation
used.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need:

- A recent checkout of Zope2; don't forget to run the wo_pcgi.py
  script to compile everything.

- A recent checkout of the Zope2 product ParsedXML, accessible
  throught <Zope2>/lib/python/Products/ParsedXML; don't forget to run
  the setup.py script to compiles Expat.

- Python 1.5.2; the driver script refuses to work with other versions
  unless you specify the -n option; this is done so that I don't
  accidentally use Python 2.x features.

- Edit the setpath.py script to set the proper module search path; the
  variable libPython should be set to the <Zope2>/lib/python directory
  that you want to use.

How To Play
-----------

(Don't forget to edit setpath.py, see above!)

The script driver.py takes an XML file with TAL markup as argument and
writes the expanded version to standard output.  The filename argument
defaults to test/test1.xml.

Regression test
---------------

There are a number of test cases in the test subdirectory, named
test/test<number>.xml.  The Python script ./runtest.py runs
./driver.py for each test case, and should print "<file> OK" for each
testcase.

What's Here
-----------

DummyEngine.py		simple-minded TALES execution engine
TALInterpreter.py	class to interpret intermediate code
TALGenerator.py		class to generate intermediate code
XMLParser.py		base class to parse XML, avoiding DOM
TALParser.py		class to parse TAL into intermediate code
driver.py		script to demonstrate TAL expansion
timer.py		script to time various processing phases
setpath.py		hack to set sys.path and import ZODB
__init__.py		empty file that makes this directory a package
runtest.py		Python script to run regression tests
ndiff.py		helper for runtest.py to produce diffs
test/			drectory with test files and output
