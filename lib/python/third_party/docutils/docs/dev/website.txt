The Docutils web site, <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>, is
maintained automatically by the docutils-update script, run as an
hourly cron job (by user "goodger").  The script will process any .txt
file which is newer than the corresponding .html file in the project's
web directory on SourceForge (``/home/groups/d/do/docutils/htdocs/``).
For a new .txt file, just SSH to SourceForge and ::

    touch filename.html
    chmod g+w filename.html
    sleep 1
    touch filename.txt

The script will take care of the rest within an hour.  Thereafter
whenever the .txt file is modified (checked in to CVS), the .html will
be regenerated automatically.

After adding directories to CVS, allow the script to run once to
create the directories in the filesystem before preparing for HTML
processing as described above.

The docutils-update__ script is in CVS as
``sandbox/davidg/infrastructure/docutils-update``.
