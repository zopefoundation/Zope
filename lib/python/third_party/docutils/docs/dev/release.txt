.. _Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/


1. Edit the version number in the following files:

   * docutils:

     - setup.py
     - HISTORY.txt
     - docutils/__init__.py

   * web: index.txt

2. Run the test suite: ``cd test ; alltests.py``.

3. Isolate from outside influence:

   (a) Remove the old installation from site-packages (including
       roman.py, and optparse.py, textwrap.py for pre-2.3
       installations).

   (b) Clear/unset the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

4. Create the release tarball:

   (a) Create a new empty directory and ``cd`` into it.

   (b) Get a clean snapshot of the CVS files::

           cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/docutils \
               export -rHEAD docutils

   (c) Use Distutils to create the release tarball::

           cd docutils
           python setup.py sdist

5. Expand and install the release tarball **in isolation** (as per
   step 3 above):

   (a) Expand the tarball in a new location, not over any existing
       files.

   (b) Install from expanded directory::

           cd docutils-X.Y
           python setup.py install

       The "install" command may require root permissions.

6. Run the test suite from the expanded archive directory: ``cd test ;
   alltests.py``.

7. Run ``cd tools ; buildhtml.py ..`` to confirm that there are no
   unexpected issues with the docs.

8. Upload the release tarball::

       $ ftp upload.sourceforge.net
       Connected to osdn.dl.sourceforge.net.
       ...
       Name (upload.sourceforge.net:david): anonymous
