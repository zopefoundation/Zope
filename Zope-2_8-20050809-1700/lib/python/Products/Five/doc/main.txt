Five, the Zope 3 in Zope 2 project
==================================
       
What is Five?
-------------

Five is a Zope 2 product that allows you to integrate Zope 3
technologies into Zope 2, today. Five right now allows you to use the
following Zope 3 technologies in Zope 2:

* Zope 3 interfaces

* adapters

* pages (views), including skins and layers, and edit and add forms

* ZCML

It is possible to add Zope 3 style views to your own Zope 2 objects,
or to existing ones, even normal Folders!

Five works with a straight Zope 2.7 installation, as long as Zope 3
has been installed. See Five's INSTALL.txt for more information on how
to set it up.

We're in the process of evaluating lots more Zope 3 technologies for
integration into Zope 2. This is the right moment for interested Zope
2 and Zope 3 developers to jump in. We're looking for cooperation
between different Zope 2 projects so that this can be a foundational
system for us all.
