Release process
---------------

Maintainers
+++++++++++

The following persons have access to the ``Zope`` package on PyPI
(in order to release new versions):

- Hanno Schlichting
- Michael Howitz
- Tres Seaver
- Jens Vagelpohl

Steps for creating a new Zope release
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Create releases for the packages mentioned in `buildout.cfg` below
  ``auto-checkout`` enter them into ``versions-prod.cfg`` and run
  ``bin/buildout`` to update ``requirements-full.txt``.

- Garden the change log and check it for spelling issues.

- Check the future PyPI long description for ReST errors::

  $ bin/longtest

- Check in the changes.

- Update version information in change log and ``setup.py``::

  $ bin/prerelease

- Pin the Zope version in ``versions-prod.cfg``.

- Run ``bin/buildout`` to update ``requirements-full.txt``.

- Commit the changes.

- Run all tests::

  $ bin/tox --pall

- Upload the tagged release to PyPI::

    $ bin/release

    or

    $ git tag -as <TAG-NAME> -m "- tagging release <TAG-NAME>"
    $ git push --tags
    $ bin/zopepy setup.py egg_info -Db '' sdist bdist_wheel
    $ bin/twine upload -s dist/Zope-<TAG-NAME>*

- Update version information::

  $ bin/postrelease
  $ vi versions-prod.cfg (remove Zope pin)
  $ bin/buildout

- Commit and push the changes.

- Check that the changes have been propagated to https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html.
  (This should be done automatically via web hooks defined in GitHub and RTD.)

- Update https://zopefoundation.github.io/Zope/::

  $ git checkout gh-pages
  $ python3.7 build_index.py

- Add the newly created files and commit and push the changes.

- Check on https://zopefoundation.github.io/Zope/ for the new release.

- Check the versions.cfg file for outdated or updated
  packages and update version information where necessary. You can get a good
  overview of outdated packages on `requires.io
  <https://requires.io/github/zopefoundation/Zope/requirements/?branch=master>`_::

  $ bin/checkversions versions-prod.cfg
  $ bin/checkversions versions.cfg
  $ bin/buildout

.. note::

    This step is done after the release to have time to fix problems which
    might get introduced by new versions of the dependencies.

    There is no version pin for `zc.buildout` as it has to be installed
    in the virtual environment but `checkversions` also prints its
    version number.

    There is no version pin for `zc.recipe.egg` in `versions-prod.cfg` as it is
    only needed for buildout install and not for pip, so we do not want to
    have it in `requirements.txt`.

    The script is called two times so the rendered version updates can be
    easily assigned to the correct file.

- Run the tests: ``bin/tox -pall``
- Build the documentation: ``bin/make-docs``
- Fix problems.
- Commit and push the changes.

- Announce the release to the world via zope-announce@zope.dev and https://community.plone.org/c/announcements.


Maintaining the Zope documentation
----------------------------------

Contributing to the documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Any signed Zope contributor may contribute to the Sphinx-based documentation
in the ``docs`` subfolder, including `The Zope Book` and the `Zope Developer's
guide`.

Just like with code contributions, please follow best practice. Test your
changes locally before creating a pull request or pushing to the repository.
Use a reasonable line length (<80).

Building the documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
After you have bootstrapped and run the buildout, you can build the
documentation using the script ``bin/make-docs`` to create the documentation
HTML output. The script will tell you where it saves the output.

The official documentation site on `Read the Docs`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pushes to the Zope repository on GitHub will automatically trigger an automatic
documentation refresh on the official documentation site at
https://zope.readthedocs.io. This is true for the ``master`` branch, but also
for versions 2.12 and 2.13. The trigger is implemented as a GitHub Webhook, see
`Settings` | `Webhooks` in the GitHub repository.

The RTD configuration at https://readthedocs.org/projects/zope/ is currently
maintained by the following people:

- Hanno Schlichting
- Michael Howitz
- Tres Seaver
- Jens Vagelpohl
