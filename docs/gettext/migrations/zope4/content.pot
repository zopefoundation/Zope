msgid "Zope 4 is using `Chameleon <https://chameleon.readthedocs.io>`_ as its new parsing engine for Page Templates. Chameleon is strict. **Very strict**. Have I mentioned that Chameleon's parsing is **extremely strict**? It will throw any sloppy HTML and TAL/TALES right in your face and refuse to compile it, even if it may be syntactically correct and the Zope 2 parsing engine has worked with it just fine."
