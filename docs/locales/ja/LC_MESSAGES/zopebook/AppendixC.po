"It may not be apparent that there needs to be an ordering. The reason "

"The reasoning behind this ordering goes like this: You often want to set "

" any switch statement. The very next thing to do is decide whether this "

"condition may depend on variables you just set, it comes after "
"``define``. It is valuable be able to replace various parts of an element"
" with different values on each iteration of a repeat, so ``repeat`` is "
"next, followed by ``case``. It makes no sense to replace attributes and "
"then throw them away, so ``attributes`` is last. The remaining statements"
