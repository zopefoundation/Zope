"When you log in to Zope, you are presented with the Zope Management "

"The Zope Management Interface represents a view into the Zope *object "

"Unlike web server applications like Apache or Microsoft IIS, Zope does "

"Instead, the objects that Zope creates are stored in a database called "
"the \"Zope Object DataBase\", or the *ZODB*.  In default configurations, "
"the ZODB creates a file named \"Data.fs\" in which Zope stores its "
"objects.  The ZMI is the primary way by which you interact with Zope "
"objects stored in this database.  Note that there are other methods of "
"interacting with objects stored in the ZODB, including WebDAV, which are "
