"Welcome to *The Zope Book*.  This book is designed to introduce you to "

#: ../../zopebook/Preface.rst:9

"To make effective use of the book, you should know how to use a web "

"You don't need to be a highly-skilled programmer in order to use Zope2, "

msgid ""
"This book has originally been written for Zope 2.6 back in 2002. It has "
"been available in an almost unmodified form for the last seven years. "
"During those many years quite a bit has happened in Zope itself and the "
"general web market."
msgstr ""

#: ../../zopebook/Preface.rst:24
msgid ""
"The 2.12 edition of this book does not try to write a new book on how-to "
"do Zope development today. Instead it tries to update the original books "
"content to be true and helpful again. Many of the underlying principles "
"of Zope2 have not changed in the last years. The ZMI, security machinery,"
" page templates and how-to use the ZCatalog are still there in an almost "
"unmodified fashion. The general ideas behind object orientation, being "
"Python based and the general architecture are still the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../zopebook/Preface.rst:32
msgid ""
"If you want to understand Zope2 you still need to understand how "
"Acquisition works, even though it has been discouraged as a way to design"
" your application logic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../zopebook/Preface.rst:36
msgid ""
"One of the most notable differences between the original Zope2 approach "
"and todays best-practices is in the way you develop applications with "
"Zope2. The original Zope2 approach has focussed on a Through-The-Web "
"(TTW) development model. You would create your entire application and "
"manage your data through the same browser interface and store everything "
"transparently in the same database. This model has worked very well in "
"the beginning of \"the web\" as many dynamic websites have been rather "
"simple and specialized projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../zopebook/Preface.rst:44
msgid ""
"Over the years websites have grown their requirements and often turned "
"into development projects of a considerable size. Today websites are "
"understood as applications in themselves and need an approach which is no"
" longer compatible with the TTW approach of the early Zope2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../zopebook/Preface.rst:49
msgid ""
"In this book you will still read about using the TTW approach for many of"
" the examples. Please understand this as a way to quickly and easily "
"learn about the underlying technologies. If you want to built an "
"application based on top of Zope2, you are almost always better of "
"approaching the project from the so called \"file-system based approach\""
" or using Python packages to extend Zope in a predictable way."
