"On this page the term \"add to your application buildout\" is used "

"For non-production environments you can use the old "
"``Products.TemporaryFolder`` temporary folder solution for storing "
"session data. But this implementation is known to randomly lose session "

"If sessions are used very sparingly you can even get away with just "
"adding a Folder object named ``temp_folder`` at the root of the ZODB and "
"restarting Zope so the necessary ZODB objects for session support are "

"producing ZODB conflict errors when storing data unless the session is "
"used very carefully to minimize write activity."
