"Version numbers for Zope have been confusing in the past. The original "

"wasn't a new version of the original Zope project and in hindsight should"
" have used a different project name. These days this effort is known as "
"BlueBream."

"In order to avoid confusion between the separate Zope 3 project and a new"

#: ../../news.rst:76
msgid ""

"Zope 4.0 takes this one step further and uses WSGI as the default setup. "

#: ../../news.rst:83
msgid ""
"The ZServer based publisher got moved into its own optional project. So "
"if you rely on ZServer features, like FTP, zdaemon or zopectl support, "
"please make sure to install ZServer and use its ``mkzopeinstance`` script"
" to create a Zope instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../news.rst:88
msgid ""
"The ZServer project also includes limited functional testing support in "
"the ``ZServer.Testing`` sub-package. testbrowser support is exclusively "
"available based on the WSGI publisher, as a result of a switch from the "
"unmaintained mechanize project to WebTest."
msgstr ""

"By default Zope only ships with a new ``mkwsgiinstance`` script which "
"creates a Zope instance configured to run as a WSGI application. The "
"example configuration uses the ``waitress`` web server, but Zope can be "
"run using any WSGI capable web server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../news.rst:98
msgid ""
"To make running Zope easier, a new ``runwsgi`` command line script got "
"added, which can read a PasteDeploy configuration and create and run the "
"WSGI pipeline specified in it. By default such a configuration is created"
" in the ``etc/zope.ini`` file. The ``runwsgi`` script supports both "
"``-v`` / ``--verbose`` and ``-d`` / ``--debug`` arguments to print out "
"more information on the console. The debug argument enables Zope's debug "
"mode and disables the catch-all part of the httpexceptions WSGI "
"middleware. This means unexpected and uncaught exceptions show their full"
" traceback on the console and make it easier to debug them. Without debug"
" mode, these exceptions result in a 500 Internal Server Error rendered as"
" a normal HTML response."

msgstr ""

#: ../../news.rst:115
msgid ""
"Although the ``zope.ini`` created by ``mkwsgiinstance`` includes "
"``egg:Zope#httpexceptions`` as part of the pipeline, this might not be "
"sufficient for existing projects. In case your project has configured a "
"middleware handling and creating error views for HTTP exceptions, you "
"need to make sure that ``egg:Zope#httpexceptions`` runs before that "
"middleware. Otherwise a ``Redirect`` might not be handled as such. This "
"can result in a non-functional ZMI."

#: ../../news.rst:123
msgid ""
"The WSGI support has no built-in support for running as a daemon. Your "
"chosen WSGI server might support this or you can use external projects "
"like supervisord or systemd."
msgstr ""

#: ../../news.rst:127
msgid ""
"The WSGI support in Zope 4 has changed in a number of ways to make it "
"more similar to its ZServer equivalent. In Zope 2.13 the WSGI support "
"required using repoze WSGI middlewares to add transaction and retry "
"handling. The WSGI support in Zope 4 no longer supports those middlewares"
" but integrates transaction and retry handling back into the publisher "
"code. This allows it to also add back full support for publication events"
" and exception views. It does mean that the transaction is begun and "
"committed or aborted inside the publisher code and you can no longer "
"write WSGI middlewares that take part in the transaction cycle, but "
"instead have to use Zope specific hooks like you do in the ZServer based "
"publisher."

msgid "View component Acquisition changes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../news.rst:142
msgid ""
"In Zope 2.12 Zope Toolkit view components changed and stopped inheriting "
"from Acquisition base classes, as Acquisition got aware of `__parent__` "
"pointers, which meant that ``aq_parent(view)`` worked, without the view "
"having to mix-in an Acquisition base class. For backwards compatibility a"
" new `AcqusitionBBB` class was mixed in, to continue to support calling "
"``view.aq_parent``. This backwards compatibility class has been removed "
"in Zope 4, so ``view.aq_parent`` no longer works and you have to use "
"``aq_parent(view)``. The same applies for other view components like view"
" page template files or viewlets."

"So far it was available via the `five.pt` project. In Zope 4 the code "

"engine is now the default, removing the need to install `five.pt` "
"manually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../news.rst:165
msgid ""
"The page template language parser in Chameleon is extremely strict. For "
"example, in Zope 2, the parser does not care about opening and closing "
"tags that are not matched in terms of being uppercase/lowercase, or "
"unmatched opening/closing tags in general. All this will now cause "
"template compilation to fail. See :ref:`zope4pagetemplatemigration` for "
