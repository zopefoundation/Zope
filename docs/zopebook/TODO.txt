General
=======

- The various webserver related chapters should mention repoze/WSGI instead
  of the FastCGI/PCGI stuff.

- Some more clarification of Zope3 - Zope Components is required.

InstallingZope
==============

- Rewrite the installation chapter to cover buildout, eggs, virtualenv and
  the modern world (Since this is 2.12, we don't need to document the old
  full tarball release anymore).

  Tres has written something in the install.txt inside the Zope2/trunk

- Refer to the plone.org/how-to/buildout-on-windows stuff for compiling from
  source on Windows.

AppendixB.rst
=============

- This was the manually maintained API documentation. Horribly outdated and
  with all the formatting impossible to convert from stx in an automated way.
